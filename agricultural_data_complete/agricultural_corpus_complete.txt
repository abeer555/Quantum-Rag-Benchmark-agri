Since 1974, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has provided support to its member countries to make their research outputs visible and accessible through FAO AGRIS; one of the most comprehensive search engines in food and agricultural scientific literature providing free access to millions of bibliographic records in 123 different languages. 
FAO AGRIS facilitates the FAO AGRIS Network with up to hundreds of organizations worldwide contributing knowledge and data to the FAO AGRIS platform, resulting in a multilingual bibliographic collection of food and agricultural scientific research with special attention to scientific information produced in the global south. Therefore, AGRIS is used by whoever is inclined to find literature on any of FAOs areas of interest. 
Who provides the data in the FAO AGRIS database?
A network of organizations, known as data providers, provide the records indexed in the database. Ranging from academic and research institutions, development programmes, and international and national organizations to governmental bodies, libraries and publishers, these data providers comprise the FAO AGRIS Network. The FAO AGRIS Network also participates in knowledge sharing and capacity development activities. 
What kinds of records are indexed in the FAO AGRIS database?
The database indexes journal articles, monographs, books, book chapters, conference proceedings, grey literature (e.g., theses and dissertations, working papers, technical reports) and datasets on a range of topics pertaining to food and agriculture (FAOs thematic areas). 
Who uses the FAO AGRIS database?
The FAO AGRIS database is a free and invaluable resource for all those interested in agriculture and food, ranging from government officials, graduate students, lecturers, librarians and other information professionals to policymakers, practitioners in the agricultural sector, professional associations and publishers and researchers.

 !One Health
One Health
The One Health approach summarises a concept that has been known for more than a century; that human, animal and plant health are interdependent and bound to the health of the ecosystems in which they exist. We envisage and implement it as a collaborative, whole of society, whole of government approach to understanding, anticipating and addressing risks to global health.

 !Antimicrobial resistance
Antimicrobial resistance
Imagine a world where infections and diseases in humans, animals and plants are impossible to treat. This worst-case scenario could become a reality as bacteria, viruses and parasites develop resistance to the drugs we use to fight them. Antimicrobial resistance, or AMR, has become one of the most pressing health issues of our time. Solutions exist and everyone has a role to play in the fight against this global threat.

Crops
The department provides advice to the Australian Government on cropping industries, including wheat and other grains, oilseeds, pulses, rice, sugar, cotton and seeds to support their continued development and growth. This involves liaison with industry, community and government, particularly through representative organisations and agencies.
The department monitors delivery of crops research and development by the Grains, Cotton, Rural Industries Research, Development Corporations and Sugar Research Australia Limited, which are accountable to the Australian Parliament through the Minister for Agriculture. The department works with these organisations to ensure that they meet government financial and accountability standards, including performance reporting.
The department also works with industry and other government agencies to improve market access and trade conditions for Australian exporters as well as managing Australias membership of the International Grains Council, the International Sugar Organisation and the International Cotton Advisory Committee.

  Research and innovation for Brazilian agriculture 
The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) was established by the countrys federal government in 1973 to develop the technological foundation for a genuinely tropical model of agriculture and animal farming. The initiative has been tasked with providing Brazil with food security and a leading position in the international market for food, fiber and energy. Embrapa today is one of the largest agricultural research corporations of the world, with over half a century of contributions focused on innovation, efficiency, sustainability and social inclusion.

Only 11 of farm holdings in the EU are run by people under the age of 40, and persuading young people to get into farming is a challenge.
Faced with an ageing farming population, the EU is stepping up its efforts to encourage young people into farming.

The CAP Strategic Plans play an important role in advancing EU agriculture towards a more sustainable farming system. They contribute to fortify the rural socio-economic structures, strengthen farm incomes, and ensure food security. They also drive climate action, and help safeguard natural resources and enhance biodiversity.
The 28 CAP Strategic Plans underway: summary of implementation in 2023-24
At a glance
Each EU country elaborated its own CAP Strategic Plan (except Belgium which has one for Flanders and one for Wallonia).
The CAP Strategic Plans include the intervention strategies, and the CAP instruments each EU country will use from 2023 to 2027 to achieve the CAP objectives. They ensure coherence across the CAP instruments, and the strategic and complementary use of resources.
In total, EU countries have planned 2 500 interventions in their CAP Strategic Plans.
The CAP Strategic Plans and their amendments are approved by the European Commission, which supports the EU countries throughout the process. For their approval, the Commission also assesses whether they contribute to, and are consistent with, the EU legislation and commitments, including those laid out in the European Green Deal.
1 January 2023 marked the entry into force of the 2023-27 CAP and the beginning of the implementation of the CAP Strategic Plans.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems towards green and climate resilient practices. CSA supports reaching internationally agreed goals such as the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. It aims to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; adapting and building resilience to climate change; and reducing andor removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. 
CSA supports the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-2031 based on the Four Betters: better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all, leaving no one behind. What constitutes a CSA practice is context-specific, depending on local socio-economic, environmental and climate change factors. FAO recommends the approach is implemented through five actions points: expanding the evidence base for CSA, supporting enabling policy frameworks, strengthening national and local institutions, enhancing funding, and financing options, and implementing CSA practices at field level.

Forests cover 31 percent of the worlds land and are fundamental to life on our planet.
Home to more than half of the worlds land animal and plant species, forests are a direct source of food, income and shelter for millions of people, and provide energy for heating and cooking for 2.6 billion. Forests are key to mitigating climate change, absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, storing more than half the global carbon stock in soils and vegetation and regulating rainfall. If sustainably managed, forests are also a source of renewable raw materials, helping to build an economy which allows nature to regenerate. 
Through its Forestry Programme, FAO seeks to restore forests, improve the lives of forest-dependent people, and support countries to manage their forests in a sustainable way. FAOs work is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, creating more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems, for better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life, leaving no one behind.

Forestry at FAO
The Forestry Division leads FAOs work in promoting the sustainable management of forests and balancing economic, social and environmental interests in landscapes surrounding them. It liaises with member countries, partners, civil society and the private sector to encourage more effective policies for management and to strengthen the role of forests in reducing the effects of climate change and helping humanity to adapt to them.
The Division also collects, analyses and shares information on the worlds forest resources and the production, trade and consumption of wood and non-wood forest products. The Committee on Forestry and six regional forestry commissions guide FAO in its technical forestry work.

We cannot end hunger and poverty without empowering both men and women in agrifood systems.
Today, agriculture and food systems face an unprecedented array of challenges. We must feed a growing global population in a context of emerging and persisting crises - economic, energy, environmental, food and social. These include conflicts, natural disasters, price volatility, market insecurity, mass migrations, health crises, and more, all of which are exacerbated by climate change, depletion of natural resources, rapid urbanization, shifts in dietary patterns and livelihood systems. 
Faced with these challenges, it is more important than ever to build inclusive, sustainable and resilient agrifood systems, so that the agricultural sector can perform to its full capacity and become more efficient. FAO recognizes that in order to achieve this, we must address the persisting inequalities that effect the underperformance of the agriculture sector in many countries. We need to work with and empower rural women, men, girls and boys. 

!IYWF
The Year will spotlight the essential roles women play across agrifood systems, from production to trade, while often going unrecognized. Women farmers are central to food security, nutrition and economic resilience.

On the arid island of Lanzarote, where black volcanic fields evoke a lunar landscape, farmers have developed a striking agricultural system. Using volcanic lapilli and sea sand to capture moisture and protect the soil, they grow grapes, sweet potatoes, and legumes. Watch the video and see how this approach sustains biodiversity, livelihoods and cultural heritage in one of Europes driest regions.

Animal Production
Animal production 
The continuous growth and transformation of the livestock sector offer substantial opportunities for agricultural development, poverty reduction, food security gains and improved human nutrition. The sector can also empower rural women and youth, improve natural resource-use efficiency, and increase the resilience of households to cope with climate shocks. 
 
However, before all of this can happen, a number of constraints and complex interactions and trade-offs need to be addressed.
FAOs role in animal production
In several countries across the world, the surging demand for livestock products is largely met by large-scale livestock production and associated food chains. Nonetheless, hundreds of millions of small-scale producers and pastoralists depend on livestock for their livelihoods. Beyond food production, farm animals play other important economic, cultural and social roles and provide multiple functions and services. They are an essential part of agro-ecosystems. 
FAO works to enhance livestocks contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by supporting the transformation of animal production systems  small and large  in ways that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.
The Organization plays a policy advisory and awareness raising role and provides technical support, advocacy, information, knowledge and guidance to help produce high quality animal products, safely, efficiently and responsibly, while improving poor peoples livelihoods and meeting consumers needs. FAO also works alongside governments and farmers, responding during and after livestock emergencies and promotes dialogue amongst public, private and civil society partners whose ultimate goal is responsible and sustainable livestock production.
Among other things, FAOs programme focuses on animal genetics, animal husbandry, animal nutrition and feeding, antimicrobial resistance, animal health and animal welfare, pastoralism and agroecology.
Key facts

Key fact 1 
Livestock contributes to nearly 40 percent of total agricultural output in developed countries and 20 percent in developing ones, supporting the livelihoods of at least 1.3 billion people worldwide. 

Key fact 2 
Thirty-four percent of global food protein supply comes from livestock. 

Key fact 3 
Livestock consume annually about 6 billion tonnes of feed dry matter, about half being grass. Eighty-six percent of the global livestock feed intake is made of resources that are not edible by humans. Cereals represent about 13 percent of the intake, and about one third of global cereal production. 

Key fact 4 
Pastoralists promote rangeland health by improving soil fertility, conserving biodiversity, managing fires and accelerating nutrient cycling. 

Areas of work
The Organization supports member countries on different overlapping issues, including:
Animal genetic resource management
 implementing the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources monitoring national breed populations;
 measuring progress towards SDG indicators 2.5.1 and 2.5.2;

Sustainable livestock production systems
 planning and implementing the sustainable development of the livestock sector by, for instance, supporting the preparation of livestock master plans to guide and implement investments and policies;
 improving livestock feeding systems, for example through enlarging the feed resource base, increasing feed safety, promoting the use of novel feed sources and related technologies, and reducing food-feed competition;
 providing guidance and technical assistance on good animal husbandry practices and animal welfare;
 reducing the use of antimicrobials in animal production;
 facilitating the implementation of animal identification and traceability, value-chain development, animal breeding programmes and livestock farmer field schools;

Livestock, climate change and natural resource use 

 enhancing the role of livestock in agroecosystems and evaluating the performance of agroecological systems;
 addressing the impacts of climate change on livestock, reducing the environmental footprint of livestock supply chains and assessing the impact of projects and investments on greenhouse gas emissions;

Pastoralism
 supporting pastoralist friendly-policies and regulations and participatory decision-making;
 supporting pastoral communities to build resilience by helping them to keep the short- and medium-term socio-economic, ecological and technical balances within and around pastoral systems.

E-LEARNING COURSES
No matter how it is defined, nutrition starts with what we eat, the products of the food and agriculture sector. By working on our agrifood systems, on the way we produce, collect, store, transport, transform and distribute foods, we can improve our diets, our health and our impact on natural resources. In lack or in excess, problems of nutrition always encompass inappropriate choices and practices. Nutrition education is an important step in empowering the consumer to make healthy food choices.
FAOs role in nutrition
Good nutrition is our first defense against disease and our source of energy to live and be active. Nutritional problems caused by an inadequate diet can be of many sorts, and when they affect a generation of youngsters, they can lower their well-being and learning capacities, thus compromising their futures. In some cases, perpetuating an inter-generational cycle of malnutrition, with severe consequences on both individuals and nations. 
While young children and women are the most vulnerable to malnutrition, the right to adequate food is universal and good nutrition is essential for all. Problems of malnutrition undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies and obesity  exist in all countries and cut across socio-economic classes. 
Emerging challenges, such as climate change, environmental sustainability and rapid technological shifts, are transforming agrifood systems and raising questions about how to ensure healthy diets for a growing world population in sustainable ways. 
At the same time, uneven economic growth, social and economic transformations and other factors are shaping food systems and diets. As a result, the prevalence of overweight, obesity and related non-communicable diseases are increasing while undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies persist. 
The Vision and Strategy for FAOs Work in Nutrition (FAO Nutrition Strategy) is part of the Organizations strategic framework, and aims at achieving the corporate goal of reducing malnutrition through efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems. The Nutrition Strategy seeks to tackle malnutrition in all its forms by accelerating policies and actions across agriculture and food systems to enable healthy diets for everyone. Through this mission, FAO will contribute to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, leaving no one behind. The FAO Nutrition Strategy seeks to improve diets and raise levels of nutrition through a people-centered approach leveraging all FAO expertise in different areas of the agrifood system, through the following actions:
 Support and facilitate action in the follow-up to the 2014 Second International Conference on Nutrition (ICN2); co-convene the 
 Support the uptake of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems and Nutrition.
 Research on and release evidence, data and guidelines on food-based approaches to improve nutrition including food composition, nutrition and diet assessment and food consumption indicators, and Food-based Dietary Guidelines. 
 Contribute to international standards and guidelines, through the provision of scientific advice to the Codex Alimentarius in relation to human nutrition requirements, in collaboration with WHO.
 Strengthen countries capacities to evaluate and monitor the nutrition situation, analyze options, and implement agricultural and agrifood systems policies and programmes that impact positively on nutrition.
 Provide tools, guidance and support for the scaling up of efficient nutrition education and consumer awareness at national and local levels, including through schools and agricultural extension services.
 Develop and provide policy and programme decision makers with tools to assess and improve market and value-chain approaches for better nutrition, with local-specific approaches targeting territorial markets and Geographical Indication food products.
 Provide data, evidence and guidance to reduce food loss and food waste in agrifood systems, in view of making them more efficient in providing the healthy diets needed for a growing global population.

FAOs statistical work
Sound and timely statistics are key to inform decisions, policies and investments that tackle issues related to food and agriculture, from hunger and malnutrition to rural poverty, from food systems productivity to the sustainable use of natural resources or to climate change.
FAO is dedicated to collecting, analysing, interpreting and disseminating food and agriculture statistics that are relevant for decision-making.
It is for this reason that developing and implementing methodologies and standards to assist countries in generating sound data and information is at the core of FAOs statistical work.
FAO also supports member countries in the collection, dissemination and uptake of data to formulate policies and plans or to better orient investments.

FAOs statutory bodies on statistics 
FAO has three statutory bodies on statistics, composed of senior statistics officials from member countries, which meet every two years:
 African Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS)
 Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS)
 Latin American and the Caribbean Commission for Agricultural Statistics (LACCAS)

Their role is to review the state of food and agricultural statistics in their respective region, to advise Members on the development and standardization of agricultural statistics within the general framework of FAOs work and to convene the study groups or other Subsidiary Bodies of national experts required for this purpose.
Quality standards and professional ethics 
FAO Statistics and Data Quality Assurance Framework (SDQAF, 2023) and the FAO Data and Statistical Standards Series adopted more recently, set out the principles and recommended best practices to ensure that FAO statistical production processes and statistical outputs are of the highest possible quality. The SQAF is based on the 
International collaboration 
FAO makes a significant contribution to global discussions related to food and agricultural statistics through its participation in international and regional statistical fora.
As the UN agency responsible for the development of methods and standards on food and agriculture statistics and for their implementation in countries, the Organization acts as the Secretariat of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Agricultural and Rural Statistics (UN-CEAG), the United Nations Expert Group on Food Security and Nutrition Data and Statistics (UN EG-FSN) and the Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP).
The Organization also participates in several Committee of experts and working groups under the

What the Numbers Say: Examining the Decline in Capital Replacement and Term Debt Repayment Margins for Illinois Grain Farms
October 31, 2025
Gerald Mashange and Bradley Zwilling
The farm machinery and equipment market faces several headwinds. In this article, we focus on the producer and extend our analysis by examining the Capital Replacement and Term Debt Repayment Margin (CRTDR margin). Importantly, what is revealed in this article is the substantial reduction in repayment capacity in recent years, which partly helps us explain some of the issues weve seen in the farm machinery and equipment market from the perspective of borrowers.

Mother Nature Bats Last: Lessons on the Cover Crop Learning Curve, Part 4
October 30, 2025
Shae Cilento, Marin Skidmore and Jonathan Coppess
If Mother Nature bats last, then federal conservation policy is barely in the game. It too-often operates with limits that drastically diminish the effectiveness of limited funding. The farmers learning curve, meanwhile, is full of risks and requires multiple seasons to work through. It is highlighted by the challenges in the all-critical spring planting window where cover crops add the most risk and could result in yield losses or even a failure to plant that could cause the farm to fail.

Rewriting the RFS Playbook: The Impact of Recent EPA Decisions on 2023-2027 RVOs for Biomass-Based Diesel
October 29, 2025
Todd Hubbs and Scott Irwin
The EPAs trilogy of recent RFS decisions represents one of the most significant regulatory developments for biomass-based diesel in the programs history. The combined effect of higher RVOs, more restrictive small refinery exemptions, and mandatory reallocation creates substantially higher biomass-based diesel requirements for 2026 and 2027. Compared to 2023-2025, revised biomass-based diesel RVOs look to increase around 50 percent over 2026-2027.

Factors Impacting Long-Run Planning
October 22, 2025
Michael Langemeier and Anil Balchhaudi
This article presents results from a recent survey pertaining to farm goals. Even though approximately 15 of respondents focused on short-term financial gains, long-run planning was positively related to each of the five goals: stable income, conservation, profit maximization, farm transfer, and reduction in farm debt. Respondents that focused more on long-run goals tended to be less risk averse than respondents that focused on short-term financial gains.

In partnership with the Government of Italy, the Pre-Summit took place in Rome from 2628 July 2021. The event set the stage for the upcoming Summit on 23 Septemeber 2021 by bringing together diverse actors from around the world to leverage the power of food systems to deliver progress on all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Summit is bringing together everyone  farmers, Indigenous Peoples, young people and citizens from across the globe  to carve a path to a world where good food for all is a reality.

A good global investment for the United Kingdom: How investing in CGIAR reduces global poverty and benefits U.K. citizens
CGIAR investments have delivered substantial economic benefits for the U.K. while reducing global poverty and food insecurity. CGIAR has boosted productivity on British farms, expanded export markets, and made food more affordable for British consumers. It has also helped prevent potential damage from pests and diseases that threaten U.K. farm livelihoods. CGIAR investments are likely to continue benefiting U.K. farmers in the future as the CGIARs provision of genetic material to the U.K. has increased over time. This paper quantifies the benefits to farmers, exporters and consumers.

A good global investment for the United States: How investing in CGIAR makes America stronger, safer and more prosperous
This report documents how CGIAR investments have delivered substantial economic, security, and diplomatic benefits for the U.S. that far exceed financial contributions. By driving agricultural innovation and providing evidence-based insights, CGIAR has boosted U.S. farm productivity, expanded export markets, and made food more affordable for American consumers. It has also helped prevent billions of dollars in potential damage from pests and diseases that threaten U.S. food security and farm livelihoods. CGIAR promotes American leadership in agricultural innovation by supplying the majority of the genetic materials used in U.S. crop breeding and acting as a critical research partner for U.S. businesses and universities. CGIAR also makes America safer and stronger through its work on predicting crises, protecting food security, and on improving livelihoods as an alternative to migration.

Estimating multidimensional development resilience
2026Lee, Seungmin; Abay, Kibrom A.; Barrett, Christopher B.; Hoddinott, John

Estimating multidimensional development resilience
Existing measures of resilience are typically based on a single well-being indicator. This is problematic in contexts where households face deprivations across multiple dimensions. We develop a multidimensional resilience measure, integrating probabilistic moment-based resilience measurement approaches with multidimensional poverty measurement methods. Applying these to household panel data from Ethiopia, we show that univariate and multidimensional resilience measures based on expenditure-based poverty, dietary diversity, and livestock asset holdings can yield varied inferences on the ranking of households as well as potential impact of development interventions. Univariate resilience measures constructed using consumption expenditure, dietary diversity and livestock asset holdings show distinct temporal and spatial distributional patterns. But while univariate measures are weakly correlated with one another and with different well-being metrics, multivariate measures exhibit much stronger rank correlations. When we contrast univariate measures of resilience to multidimensional measures of resilience, we find that the latter vary less over the study period; multidimensional resilience measures seem to capture more persistent or structural vulnerability and associated capacity of households. We also demonstrate the differences in these univariate and multivariate measures, including the potential of the composite multidimensional resilience measures for supporting targeting processes.

Making a Difference Blog Series

In 2014, IFPRI and the Gates Foundation launched the AReNA project to bridge agriculture and nutrition research, addressing data gaps and advancing understanding of how agriculture can better improve diets and nutrition worldwide.
The AReNA project created a one-of-a-kind dataset that links nutrition-related indicators to agricultural and environmental indicators. The dataset has been used for countless studies on the determinants of child stunting, wasting, and feeding practices.
AReNA was the first project to use the World Banks International Comparison Program (ICP) data on retail food pricescovering 175 countries and 800 food itemsto study the affordability of healthy and unhealthy diets. It significantly influenced the adoption of healthy diet metrics in FAO-led _State of Food Security and Nutrition_ reports and led to the widely-cited findingused by the FAO, World Bank, and othersthat 3 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet.

Following the Second Lead [](https:www.ipcc.ch20250917prfod1225)
The IPCC was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.
Through its assessments, the IPCC determines the state of knowledge on climate change. It identifies where there is agreement in the scientific community on topics related to climate change, and where further research is needed. The reports are drafted and reviewed in several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency. The IPCC does not conduct its own research. IPCC reports are neutral, policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive. The assessment reports are a key input into the international negotiations to tackle climate change. Created by the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988, the IPCC has 195 Member countries. In the same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC.

Activities
The main activity of the IPCC is the preparation of reports assessing the state of knowledge of climate change. These include assessment reports, special reports and methodology reports. To deliver this work programme, the IPCC holds meetings of its government representatives, convening as plenary sessions of the Panel or IPCC Working Groups to approve, adopt and accept reports. Plenary Sessions of the IPCC also determine the IPCC work programme, and other business including its budget and outlines of reports. The IPCC Bureau meets regularly to provide guidance to the Panel on scientific and technical aspects of its work. The IPCC organizes scoping meetings of experts and meetings of lead authors to prepare reports. It organizes expert meetings and workshops on various topics to support its work programme, and publishes the proceedings of these meetings. To communicate its findings and explain its work, the IPCC takes part in outreach activities organized by the IPCC or hosted by other organizations, and provides speakers to other conferences.

Reports
The IPCC prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about the state of scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for reducing the rate at which climate change is taking place. It also produces Special Reports on topics agreed to by its member governments, as well as Methodology Reports that provide guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas inventories. The latest report is the Sixth Assessment Report which consists of three Working Group contributions and a Synthesis Report. The Working Group I contribution was finalized in August 2021, the Working Group II contribution in February 2022, the Working Group III contribution in April 2022 and the Synthesis Report in March 2023. 
The IPCC is currently in its seventh assessment cycle which formally began in July 2023 with elections of the new Chair and new IPCC and TFI Bureaus.

Working Groups and Task Force
IPCC assessments and special reports are prepared by three Working Groups, each looking at a different aspect of the science related to climate change: Working Group I (The Physical Science Basis), Working Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability), and Working Group III (Mitigation of Climate Change). The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, whose main objective is to develop and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals. The Working Groups and Task Force handle the preparation of reports, selecting and managing the experts that work on them as authors. The activities of each Working Group and the Task Force are supported by their Technical Support Units (TSU).
Working Group I

The Regeneration International Standard
The Regeneration International Standard has been crafted in a format that is more accessible for farmers, rather than adopting a regulatory standard format. The standard is mainly informative rather than normative. It includes the Definition, General Principles, Guidance, and clear Prohibitions. This separate Guidance Document is written to assist certifiers and operators in understanding how to comply with the standard.
OUR VISION
A healthy global ecosystem in which practitioners of regenerative agriculture and land use, in concert with consumers, educators, business leaders and policymakers, cool the planet, feed the world and restore public health, prosperity and peace on a global scale.
OUR WORK
We work with multiple stakeholders in key regions of the world who are committed to building alternative food and farming systems on a regional or national level. We are currently assisting in the building of numerous Regeneration Alliances, including those in South Africa, India, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Canada, and in the Midwest region of the U.S.A.

Must read book by Ronnie Cummins  André Leu  
Foreword by Vandana Shiva 
The Regenerative Agriculture Solution
...
Read this book to understand why you should care about regenerative agriculture. Until the public is better-informed and insists on sweeping changes to current agricultural policy . . . we will continue to degrade our planet and destabilize our climate. Leu and Cummins, through inspiring stories and solid science, show just how quickly we could turn that around. -Allan Savory, president, Savory Institute; chairman, Africa Centre for Holistic Management

on Saturday
A growing number of wood industry certifications are designed to guide consumers to sustainably and ethically producing wood products. Theyre not perfect. Some have rules written by big timber. Almost all of them receive payments from companies seeking certifications. There is no seal that encompasses every issue, but dont let perfect be the enemy of good  even the most flawed badges have some baseline value.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

 Plant Health and Research

Advances in science, many of them from scientists at USDA or through research funded by USDA, have opened up new options for farmers responding to market needs and environmental challenges. 
Many new plant varieties being developed or grown by farmers have been produced using genetic engineering, which involves manipulating the plants genes through techniques of modern molecular biology often referred to as recombinant DNA technology. These techniques are included in what is often referred to as biotechnology or modern biotechnology.
USDA supports the safe and appropriate use of science and technology, including biotechnology, to help meet agricultural challenges and consumer needs of the 21st century. USDA plays a key role in assuring that biotechnology plants and products derived from these plants are safe to be grown and used in the United States. Once these plants and products enter commerce, USDA supports bringing these and other products to the worldwide marketplace.
A Shared Government Responsibility for the Safety of Agricultural Biotechnology-Derived Products
Three federal agencies are involved in ensuring that plants produced using biotechnology and the many products derived from them are safe for farmers to use, safe to consume as food or feed, and safe for the environment. These are USDAs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The three agencies regulate these products based on the characteristics of the actual products and their intended uses, and they operate under the existing laws passed by Congress to ensure the safety of plants used in agriculture, the safety of pesticides used in agriculture, and the safety of foods we eat and feeds given to animals. Many other USDA agencies have roles in the development, use, and marketing of these products as well.
Learn more about How the U.S. Government Regulates Biotech Plants.
Farmer Adoption of Agricultural Biotechnology-Derived Crops
Since the first successful commercialization of a biotechnology-derived crop in the 1990s, many new crop varieties have been developed and made available to U.S. farmers and farmers worldwide. U.S. farmers have rapidly adopted many of these new GE varieties, so that in 2012, 88 percent of the corn, 94 percent of the cotton, and 93 percent of the soybeans planted in the U.S. were varieties produced through genetic engineering. A large proportion of the production of other crops, such as alfalfa, and papaya, and sugar beet, is also biotech-derived.
Read more about the reasons behind this trend and about how farming practices and the marketplace have changed on USDAs Economic Research Service Biotechnology page.
Importance of Trade in Agricultural Biotechnology Products
The United States is the largest exporter of agricultural products, which helps feed the worlds population, and our export markets are critical to the health of U.S. farm communities around the country. Most of the corn and soybeans we export are biotechnology-derived, and this means that working with our trading partners is critical to help them understand the technical aspects of new products and how we have determined that they meet our high safety standards, to open up new markets, and to ensure that our products are treated fairly in the global marketplace.
Helping USDA Manage Long-Term Implications
The increasing use of biotechnology in agriculture has changed, and will continue to change, farming and the work of USDA in the long-term. To help understand and address these changes, USDA established the Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture (AC21). One critical area where the committee has focused its attention is how farmers who produce different crops intended for different customers-biotechnology-derived, conventional, or organic-can best co-exist and produce the crops that meet their customers needs. The AC21 has provided a report to USDA, with recommendations, on this subject.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

 Climate Change Adaptation and USDA

Climate change presents real threats to U.S. agricultural production, forest resources, and rural economies. Producers and land managers across the country are experiencing climate impacts through shifting weather patterns and increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods, drought, and wildfire.

Climate Change Affects U.S. Agriculture 
and Rural Communities
Climate change presents real threats to U.S. agricultural production, forest resources, and rural economies. Producers and land managers across the country are experiencing climate impacts on their operations through shifting weather patterns and increasingly frequent and severe storms, floods, drought, and wildfire. 

[](https:www.usda.govabout-usdageneral-informationprioritiesclimate-solutions)
 
These threats have significant implicationsnot just for farmers, ranchers, and forest landownersbut also for surrounding communities and all Americans.
The Department is developing a comprehensive strategy centered on voluntary incentives that is inclusive for all agricultural producers, landowners, and communities, and that builds on the 90-Day Progress Report on Climate-Smart Agriculture and Forestry (PDF, 561 KB).
Additionally, USDAs 
The 
Agriculture Plays a Critical Role 
in Delivering Climate Change Solutions
The American agriculture sector has an incredible potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, and deliver lasting solutions to the climate crisis.
Americas producers are already leading the way. In recent years, carbon stored in cultivated cropland soils increased by more than 8.8 million tons annually (PDF, 1.9 MB) thanks to their voluntary conservation efforts. Farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners are ready, and USDA offers resources to help. 

[](https:www.usda.govabout-usdageneral-informationprioritiesclimate-solutions)
 
USDAs Natural Resources Conservation Service provides financial assistance and one-on-one technical support to assist producers in implementing climate-smart conservation practices such as no-till, cover crops, prescribed grazing, and silvopasture. This empowers producers to both strengthen their operations resilience to climate-related disaster events while leveraging their lands potential to sequester and store carbon, thereby delivering lasting climate solutions.
A suite of resources for agricultural producers and conservation partners is available at 
Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities 
Funding Opportunity
USDA is investing up to 2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity, with projects from the second funding pool to be announced later this year. This effort will increase the competitive advantage of U.S. agriculture both domestically and internationally, build wealth that stays in rural communities, and support a diverse range of producers and operation types. 

[](https:www.usda.govabout-usdageneral-informationprioritiesclimate-solutions)
 
On February 7, 2022, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture would invest 1 billion in partnerships to expand market opportunities for climate-smart commodities and support Americas climate-smart farmers, ranchers, and forest landowners. Because of the unprecedented demand and interest in Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities, and the potential for meaningful opportunities to benefit producers through the proposals, USDA has tripled this commitment to more than 3 billion. On September 14, 2022, Secretary Vilsack announced USDA is investing up to 2.8 billion in 70 selected projects under the first funding pool of the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding opportunity, with projects from the second funding pool to be announced later this year.
Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities will finance pilot projects that create market opportunities for U.S. agricultural and forestry products that use climate-smart practices and include innovative, cost-effective ways to measure and verify greenhouse gas benefits. USDA is no longer accepting project applications for this funding opportunity.
This funding opportunity defines climate-smart commodities as being produced using agricultural (farming, ranching, or forestry) practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester carbon. Funding will be provided to partners through the USDAs Commodity Credit Corporation for pilot projects. Spanning up to five years, the 70 projects announced on September 14 will:
 Provide technical and financial assistance to producers to implement climate-smart production practices on a voluntary basis on working lands;
 Pilot innovative and cost-effective methods for quantification, monitoring, reporting and verification of greenhouse gas benefits; and
 Develop markets and promote the resulting climate-smart commodities.

USDA anticipates that these 70 projects will result in:
 Hundreds of expanded markets and revenue streams for producers and commodities across agriculture ranging from traditional corn to specialty crops.
 More than 50 thousand farms reached, encompassing over 20-25 million acres of working land engaged in climate-smart production practices such as cover crops, no-till and nutrient management.
 More than 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent sequestered over the lives of the projects. This is equivalent to removing more than 10 million gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road for one year.
 More than 50 universities, including multiple minority-serving institutions, engaged and helping advance projects, especially with outreach and monitoring, measurement, reporting and verification.
 Proposals for the 70 selected projects include plans to match on average over 50 of the federal investment with nonfederal funds.

This infographic (PNG, 1.0 MB) includes additional metrics on projects from the Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities first funding pool.

Combatting the Causes and Effects of Climate Change
Since January 2021, USDA has announced a suite of updates to the Departments programs, positioning farmers, ranchers, forest landowners, and rural communities to be leaders in emissions reductions and carbon sequestration and supporting them in managing the impacts of climate change.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

Land Conservation
USDA recognizes that conservation by farmers, ranchers and forest owners today means thriving and sustainable agriculture for our future.

 Land Conservation
 Wildlife

Seventy percent of the nations land is privately owned and conservation of our nations private lands not only results in healthy soil, water, air, plants, animals and ecosystems, it also provides productive and sustainable working lands.
Working with Individual Landowners on Conservation
USDA provides voluntary, incentive-based conservation to landowners through local field offices in nearly every county of the nation. USDA helped landowners develop conservation plans and enrolled a record number of acres of private working lands in conservation programs, working with more than 500,000 farmers and ranchers to implement conservation practices that clean the air we breathe, conserve and clean the water we drink, prevent soil erosion and create and protect wildlife habitat. USDA support - leveraged with historic outside investments - helped support producer incomes and reward them for their good work.
Learn more about conservation programs.
Promoting Landscape Scale Conservation
USDAs landscape-scale initiatives are making impacts on conservation priorities across entire landscapes by working with partners and landowners to deliver results. Work in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Mississippi River Basin, and Gulf of Mexico are among the initiatives that are applying the most effective conservation practices in the best places to increase agricultural and environmental returns. New science is helping to focus work in areas where we will generate 3-to-5 times the benefits of more general approaches - reducing problematic nutrients making it to rivers and streams by as much as 45.
Learn more about landscape conservation initiatives.
Promoting Good Health and Economic Vitality Through Outdoor Recreation
USDA-managed National Forests and Grasslands provide opportunities for over 165 million visitors each year to experience the wonders of nature and be physically active. These recreational uses also support an estimated 200,000 full and part time jobs and contribute almost 13 billion to local communities each year. Over the last two years, USDA has helped support more than 25 state public access programs and opened an estimated 2.4 million acres for hunting, fishing and other outdoor recreational opportunities on privately-owned lands. Additionally, almost 30 million in grants, provided through the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, will help promote an estimated 35 percent increase in the number of participating landowners and increase outdoor recreation in these states by 21 percent.
USDA has enrolled more than one million acres of private working lands specifically to protect habitat for duck, pheasant, quail and other birds through continuous signup Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) initiatives. Along with the U.S. Department of Interior, USDA established a Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR) to improve recreational access to federal lands across federal agencies and proposed a special 5 million set-aside in the Land and Water Conservation Fund to improve hunting and fishing access to federal lands.
Developing Regulatory Certainty and Promoting Ecosystem Services
Since 2009, USDA has awarded more than 200 conservation innovation grants to support exploration of new solutions to conservation. Also, the Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative helps farmers and ranchers conserve the habitat of seven species with declining populations. USDA reached a historic agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to provide certainty to landowners who implement and maintain certain conservation practices that protect specific species. This enables producers to continue to manage their lands even if the species is later added to the endangered species list.
Working with the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA is supporting States and others in efforts to establish water quality trading markets. This demonstrates the potential for farmers and ranchers to receive new revenue streams while delivering cost effective results for industries regulated under the greenhouse gas estimation guidelines and tools that assess greenhouse gas reductions and carbon sequestration resulting conservation, land management activities, and tree planting will also help farmers earn revenue for their work as they protect the environment.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

USDA works everyday to strengthen the American agricultural economy. Despite the difficult economic climate of the past years, our efforts - coupled with the 2008 Farm Bill, the Recovery Act, and the hard work and resilience of Americas farmers and ranchers - are helping American agriculture lead the nations recovery. We maintain a strong and appropriate safety net for Americas farmers, ranchers and growers which includes assistance to struggling industries, disaster assistance, and crop insurance, and provide technical assistance, access to credit, and help producers implement conservation practices.
To ensure that America remains the world leader in crop production, we conduct cutting-edge agricultural research. And to build a stronger agricultural economy for future generations, we work to improve both domestic and international markets, to create new income opportunities - like renewable energy - for Americas producers, and to grow the next generation of American farmers.
If youre new to farming and want to start a farm, start here. The New Farmers website offers a wealth of information and resources on how to start a farm, making a business plan, access to land and capital, risk management, taxes, safety, and more!

 Nutrition Programs programs that include child nutrition programs, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and emergency food assistance among many other programs.)
 Research and Science

USDA is responsible for providing a safety net for millions of Americans who are food-insecure and for developing and promoting dietary guidance based on scientific evidence. USDA works to increase food security and reduce hunger by providing children and low-income people access to food, a healthful diet, and nutrition education in a way that supports American agriculture and inspires public confidence.
USDA provides critical nutrition assistance through Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) programs that include child nutrition programs, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and emergency food assistance among many other programs. The Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP) is responsible for developing and promoting dietary guidance that links the best evidence-based scientific research to the nutrition needs of Americans.
Child Nutrition Programs
Child Nutrition Programs administered by FNS provide healthy food to children through programs that include the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, Child and Adult Care Food Program, Summer Food Service Program and the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program.
During summer months, USDA works with community sponsors to serve millions of meals to low-income children through the Summer Food Service Program. This program helps fight hunger and obesity by reimbursing organizations such as schools, child care centers, and after-school programs for providing healthy meals to children.
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, commonly known as WIC, promotes healthy birth outcomes and early child development by providing food packages, health screenings and referrals, breastfeeding promotion and support, and nutrition education for low-income pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women, infants, and children up to 5 years of age who are found to be at nutritional risk.
The WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program (FMNP) provides fresh, unprepared, locally grown fruits and vegetables to WIC participants. The Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP) provides vouchers for eligible low-income seniors to purchase fresh fruits and vegetables at farmers markets and roadside stands, as well as through community supported agriculture programs.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) serves as the primary source of nutrition assistance for millions of low-income people monthly. It increases food purchasing power for eligible households with benefits that can be used to buy food at authorized retail grocery stores and farmers markets across the country.
State agencies operate SNAP according to national eligibility and benefit standards set by Federal law and regulations, implement strategies to promote healthy choices and prevent obesity among participants, provide employment and training services to help participants move to self-sufficiency, and are responsible for ensuring integrity in certification and benefit issuance. USDA oversees over 250,000 food retailers that redeem benefits.
Additional Nutrition Programs
USDA administers many other programs to strengthen the nutrition safety net. For example, the FNS Food Distribution Programs distribute USDA-purchased food to school children and low-income families, emergency feeding programs, Indian reservations, and the elderly. USDA purchases a variety of food products in support of the National School Lunch program and other Federal feeding programs. These purchases help to stabilize prices in agricultural commodity markets by balancing supply and demand.
In addition, the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, within the Office of the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, works to improve the health of all Americans by developing and promoting dietary guidance that links scientific research to the nutrition needs of consumers. It provides national leadership, technical expertise, and cooperation for development of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and Federal nutrition and economic initiatives.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

 Research and Science

From fostering continued economic growth and opportunities for farmers and ranchers to addressing food security to preserving a safe, sustainable, affordable U.S. food and fiber system, the United States is a leader in global agriculture. Each day, the work of USDA scientists and researchers touches the lives of all Americans - from the farm to the kitchen table, from the forests to waterways, and from to the air we breathe to the energy that powers our country.
The challenges facing agriculture, natural resources, and conservation are immense and can be addressed through robust research and educational programs. USDA intramural and extramural science helps to protect, secure, and improve our food, agricultural and natural resources systems.
Strengthening Our Research System
USDA has refocused its science agencies to ensure the most effective and efficient use of its resources, while leveraging the strengths of our partners across the scientific community.
The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) coordinates USDA research, education and Extension activities with scientists and researchers across USDA, the federal government, and with university and private partners to make the best use of taxpayer investments.
The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is USDAs principal in-house research agency. ARS leads America towards a better future through agricultural research and information.
The Economic Research Service (ERS) anticipate trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America and conducts high-quality, objective economic research to inform decision making.
The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducts hundreds of surveys every year and prepares objective, timely statistical reports covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture.
The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) directs federal research funding to research that finds innovative solutions to issues related to agriculture, food, the environment, and communities through extramural research, Extension, and higher education.
AGARDA: A Vision for Disruptive Science to Confront Audacious Challenges
Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority (AGARDA) Implementation Strategy (PDF, 1.8 MB) is a framework outlining a new approach for delivering disruptive breakthrough discoveries for agriculture.
Enhancing the Productivity of American Agriculture and Ensuring the Safety of our Food Supply
USDA invests in research, development, and outreach of new varieties and technologies to mitigate animalplant diseases and increase productivity, sustainability, and product quality. USDA research has supported Americas farmers and ranchers in their work to produce a safe and abundant food supply for over 100 years. This work has helped feed the nation and sustain an agricultural trade surplus since the 1960s.
An additional focus is to establish more sustainable systems that enhance crop and animal health. Our scientists and university partners have revealed the genetic blueprints of a host of plants and animals including the genomes of apples, pigs, and turkeys, and in 2012, they furthered understanding of the tomato, bean, wheat and barley genomes -- key drivers in developing the resilience of those crops to feed growing populations.
NASS has developed animated avian influenza, mycobacterial disease, coccidiosis, campylobacterosis, mastitis and others.
USDA conducts and supports science that informs decisions and policies contributing to a safe food supply and the reduction of foodborne hazards. Our scientists found the primary site where the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease begins infection in cattle and developed an improved vaccine against the disease. They are also working on new strategies to control mites and other major honey bee problems such as colony collapse disorder.
Conserving Natural Resources and Combating Climate Change
USDA develops and delivers science-based knowledge that empowers farmers, foresters, ranchers, landowners, resource managers, policymakers, and Federal agencies to manage the risks, challenges, and opportunities of climate variability, and that informs decision-making and improves practices in environmental conservation.
Our scientists are developing rice and corn crops that are drought- and flood-resistant and helping to improve the productivity of soil, as well as production systems that require increasing smaller amounts of pesticides or none at all.
Vegetation indices contained in 
Additionally, our researchers have examined the potential impacts of a suite of climate scenarios on U.S. crop production. Studies like these will help policymakers, farmers, industry leaders and others better understand and adapt to a changing climate on Americas crop production.
Our researchers created 
USDA supports families managing through tough economic times by helping residents save energy at home and conserve water, with a program run by Cooperative Extension and our land-grant university partners. Cooperative Extension-affiliated volunteer monitoring programs have engaged citizens in water monitoring to better understand the effects of climate change andor aquatic invasive species on local waters. Collectively, these programs interacted with hundreds of local, State, and Federal partners. The programs help citizens detect the presence of invasive species and harmful algal blooms.
Science Education and Extension
USDA recognizes the importance of recruiting, cultivating, and developing the next generation of scientists, leaders, and a highly skilled workforce for food, agriculture, natural resources, forestry, environmental systems, and life sciences.
The NIFA interagency agreement with the 
USDA strives to provide effective research, education, and extension activities that inform public and private decision-making in support of rural and community development. NASS holds outreach events throughout the Census cycle with underserved and minority and disadvantaged farming groups to promote participation in the Census of Agriculture. With funding and support from NIFA, many Tribal Colleges are offering Reservation citizens training ranging from basic financial literacy to business start-up and marketing information so that families not only survive, but thrive.
In addition, the ERS Atlas of Rural and Small Town America brings together over 80 demographic, economic, and agricultural statistics for every county in all 50 states and assembles statistics in four broad categories -- people, jobs, agriculture, and geography.

Improving Nutrition and Confronting Obesity
USDA builds the scientific evidence for food-based and physical activity strategies and develops effective education activities to promote health and reduce malnutrition and obesity in children and high-risk populations. For instance, USDA Team Nutrition is an initiative of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service to support child nutrition programs through training and technical assistance for foodservice, nutrition education for children and their caregivers, and school and community support for healthy eating and physical activity.
USDA-supported research investigates the role of food in optimizing health throughout the life cycle for all Americans. In these efforts, USDAs Agricultural Research Services human nutrition researchers conduct scientific, evidence-based research that is the foundational base for the

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

Climate-smart agriculture 
Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an integrated approach to managing landscapescropland, livestock, forests and fisheries--that address the interlinked challenges of food security and climate change. 
 
Overview
Climate change and food and nutrition insecurity pose two of the greatest development challenges of our time. Yet a more sustainable food system can not only heal the planet, but ensure food security for all.
Today, the global agrifood system emits of all emissions. Global food demand is estimated to 
Food systems are the leading source of methane emissions and biodiversity loss, and they use around 70 of fresh water. If food waste were a country, it would be the third highest emitter in the world. Meanwhile, emissions from agriculture are increasing in developing countries  a worrying trend which must be reversed.
Without significant climate mitigation action in the agri-food sector, the Paris Agreement goals cannot be reached. Agriculture is the primary cause of deforestation, threatening pristine ecosystems such as the Amazon and the Congo Basin. Without action, emissions from food systems will rise even further, with increasing food production.
Achieving the Triple Win of CSA
The global agrifood system must therefore deliver on multiple fronts. It must feed the world, adapt to climate change, and drastically reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. In response to these challenges, the concept of Climate-smart Agriculture (CSA) has emerged as a holistic approach to end food security and promote sustainable development while addressing climate change issues.
CSA is a set of agricultural practices and technologies which simultaneously boost productivity, enhance resilience and reduce GHG emissions. Although it is built on existing agricultural knowledge, technologies, and sustainability principles, CSA is distinct in several ways. First, it has an explicit focus on addressing climate change in the agrifood system. Second, CSA systematically considers the synergies and tradeoffs that exist between productivity, adaptation, and mitigation. And third, CSA encompasses a range of practices and technologies that are tailored to specific agro-ecological conditions and socio-economic contexts including the adoption of climate-resilient crop varieties, conservation agriculture techniques, agroforestry, precision farming, water management strategies, and improved livestock management. By implementing these practices, triple win results can be achieved:
1. Increased productivity: Produce more and higher quality food without putting an additional strain on natural resources, to improve nutrition security and boost incomes, especially for 
2. Enhanced resilience: Reduce vulnerability to droughts, pests, diseases and other climate-related risks and shocks; and improve the capacity to adapt and grow in the face of longer-term stresses like increased seasonal variability and more erratic weather patterns.
3. Reduced emissions: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions of the food system, avoid deforestation due to cropland expansion, and increase the carbon sequestration of plants and soils.
Finally, funding for CSA needs to be increased to align available finance with the relevance of the sector. Despite causing one third of global greenhouse gas emissions, agrifood systems receive 4 of climate finance, with only 
Climate-Smart Agriculture and the World Bank Group
The World Bank has significantly scaled up its engagement and investment in climate-smart agriculture (CSA). In its the World Bank has identified Agriculture, Food, Water and Land as one of the five key transitions needed to tackle the Paris Agreement. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, the World Bank has increased financing for CSA by eight times, to almost 3 billion annually.
As of July 2023, all new World Bank operations must be aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement, meaning that CSA is at the core of all the World Banks new agriculture and food operations. To this end, the World Bank has prepared a Sector Note of Paris Alignment of its Agriculture and Food operations. Furthermore, all projects are screened for climate and disaster risks. Climate change indicators are used to measure outputs and outcomes, and greenhouse gas accounting of projects is conducted prior to approval . These actions will help client countries implement their 
The World Bank engages strategically with countries, supporting them to enhance productivity, improve resilience and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The World Bank uses the following tools, diagnostics and other analytics to help countries in the transition towards sustainable agriculture.
 Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs), new core diagnostics, help countries prioritize the most impactful actions that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and boost adaptation, while delivering on broader development goals. CCDRs identify climate impacts on countries agrifood systems, such as reduced yields and increased food prices, and present a variety of country-specific technology options as well as policy reforms under the umbrella of CSA.
 Climate-Smart Agriculture Investment Plans (CSAIPs) developed for a subset of client countries aim to mainstream CSA into national agricultural policies and to identify investment opportunities in CSA. The World Bank provides technical assistance and financial support to help countries develop and implement CSAIPs. These plans prioritize investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, capacity building, and knowledge sharing to promote sustainable agricultural practices. CSAIPs are available, or currently under preparation, for Bangladesh, Belize, .pdf) Burkina Faso, Cote DIvoire, Cameroon, the Republic of Congo, Ghana, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Lesotho, Madagascar, Mali, Nepal, Senegal, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
 The World Bank also supports research programs such as with the 

Working Toward Resilience and Food and Nutrition Security, while Curbing GHG Emissions
The Banks support of CSA is making a difference across the globe, for example:
 A new US345 million loan for the China Green Agricultural and Rural Revitalization Program for Results will support Chinas global public goods agenda by promoting the greening of agriculture and rural development in Hubei and Hunan provinces in central China. The program will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crop and livestock farming, increase carbon sequestration in farmlands, and improve biodiversity protection and restoration in agricultural ecosystems, while strengthening the institutional capacity of local governments to integrate environmental and decarbonization objectives in government rural revitalization plans and investments. World Bank financing will complement a US4.1 billion commitment by the Government of China (GoC).
 The US621 million Food Systems Resilience Program for Eastern and Southern Africa (Phase 3) FSRP Project in Kenya, Comoros, Malawi, Somalia aims to increase the resilience of food systems and the recipients preparedness for food insecurity. The project has six components, including building resilient agricultural production capacity to strengthen the productivity and resilience of domestic food production to shocks and stressors, by supporting the development and adoption of improved agricultural inputs and services and climate-smart and gender-sensitive farming technologies in the crops, livestock, and fisheries sectors.
 A US200 million credit for the Punjab Resilient and Inclusive Agriculture Transformation Project (PRIAT) will help Pakistan enhance access to, and productivity of, agricultural water, and improve incomes of farmers supported by the project. PRIAT will notably reduce the differences in water availability among head, middle, and tail end users of watercourses, increase agricultural output per unit of water used at farm level for selected crops, increase the share of area under high-value crops cultivation, and increase agriculture incomes of households participating in project activities, yielding important climate change adaptation and mitigation co-benefits.
 The US125 million Agriculture Resilience, Value Chain Development and Innovation (ARDI) program will play a pivotal role in strengthening the transition Jordans agri-food sector. It supports Jordans National Sustainable Agriculture Plan and aims to enhance climate resilience, competitiveness, and inclusivity of the agri-food sector. Over the next five years, it will support 30,000 farming household with the adoption of climate-smart and water-efficient agricultural practices, provide needs-based training, create about 12,000 employment opportunities, and promote value chain and export promotion through advanced market diagnostics. A particular focus will be on strengthening the participation of women, youth and refugees.
