Since 1974, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has provided support to its member countries to make their research outputs visible and accessible through FAO AGRIS; one of the most comprehensive search engines in food and agricultural scientific literature providing free access to millions of bibliographic records in 123 different languages. 
FAO AGRIS facilitates the FAO AGRIS Network with up to hundreds of organizations worldwide contributing knowledge and data to the FAO AGRIS platform, resulting in a multilingual bibliographic collection of food and agricultural scientific research with special attention to scientific information produced in the global south. Therefore, AGRIS is used by whoever is inclined to find literature on any of FAOs areas of interest. 
Who provides the data in the FAO AGRIS database?
A network of organizations, known as data providers, provide the records indexed in the database. Ranging from academic and research institutions, development programmes, and international and national organizations to governmental bodies, libraries and publishers, these data providers comprise the FAO AGRIS Network. The FAO AGRIS Network also participates in knowledge sharing and capacity development activities. 
What kinds of records are indexed in the FAO AGRIS database?
The database indexes journal articles, monographs, books, book chapters, conference proceedings, grey literature (e.g., theses and dissertations, working papers, technical reports) and datasets on a range of topics pertaining to food and agriculture (FAOs thematic areas). 
Who uses the FAO AGRIS database?
The FAO AGRIS database is a free and invaluable resource for all those interested in agriculture and food, ranging from government officials, graduate students, lecturers, librarians and other information professionals to policymakers, practitioners in the agricultural sector, professional associations and publishers and researchers.

 News

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an approach that helps guide actions to transform agri-food systems towards green and climate resilient practices. CSA supports reaching internationally agreed goals such as the SDGs and the Paris Agreement. It aims to tackle three main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; adapting and building resilience to climate change; and reducing andor removing greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. 
CSA supports the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-2031 based on the Four Betters: better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all, leaving no one behind. What constitutes a CSA practice is context-specific, depending on local socio-economic, environmental and climate change factors. FAO recommends the approach is implemented through five actions points: expanding the evidence base for CSA, supporting enabling policy frameworks, strengthening national and local institutions, enhancing funding, and financing options, and implementing CSA practices at field level.

Forests cover 31 percent of the worlds land and are fundamental to life on our planet.
Home to more than half of the worlds land animal and plant species, forests are a direct source of food, income and shelter for millions of people, and provide energy for heating and cooking for 2.6 billion. Forests are key to mitigating climate change, absorbing carbon dioxide from the air, storing more than half the global carbon stock in soils and vegetation and regulating rainfall. If sustainably managed, forests are also a source of renewable raw materials, helping to build an economy which allows nature to regenerate. 
Through its Forestry Programme, FAO seeks to restore forests, improve the lives of forest-dependent people, and support countries to manage their forests in a sustainable way. FAOs work is fully aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals, creating more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems, for better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life, leaving no one behind.

Forestry at FAO
The Forestry Division leads FAOs work in promoting the sustainable management of forests and balancing economic, social and environmental interests in landscapes surrounding them. It liaises with member countries, partners, civil society and the private sector to encourage more effective policies for management and to strengthen the role of forests in reducing the effects of climate change and helping humanity to adapt to them.
The Division also collects, analyses and shares information on the worlds forest resources and the production, trade and consumption of wood and non-wood forest products. The Committee on Forestry and six regional forestry commissions guide FAO in its technical forestry work.

Animal Production
Animal production 
The continuous growth and transformation of the livestock sector offer substantial opportunities for agricultural development, poverty reduction, food security gains and improved human nutrition. The sector can also empower rural women and youth, improve natural resource-use efficiency, and increase the resilience of households to cope with climate shocks. 
 
However, before all of this can happen, a number of constraints and complex interactions and trade-offs need to be addressed.
FAOs role in animal production
In several countries across the world, the surging demand for livestock products is largely met by large-scale livestock production and associated food chains. Nonetheless, hundreds of millions of small-scale producers and pastoralists depend on livestock for their livelihoods. Beyond food production, farm animals play other important economic, cultural and social roles and provide multiple functions and services. They are an essential part of agro-ecosystems. 
FAO works to enhance livestocks contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by supporting the transformation of animal production systems  small and large  in ways that are economically, socially and environmentally sustainable.
The Organization plays a policy advisory and awareness raising role and provides technical support, advocacy, information, knowledge and guidance to help produce high quality animal products, safely, efficiently and responsibly, while improving poor peoples livelihoods and meeting consumers needs. FAO also works alongside governments and farmers, responding during and after livestock emergencies and promotes dialogue amongst public, private and civil society partners whose ultimate goal is responsible and sustainable livestock production.
Among other things, FAOs programme focuses on animal genetics, animal husbandry, animal nutrition and feeding, antimicrobial resistance, animal health and animal welfare, pastoralism and agroecology.
Key facts

Key fact 1 
Livestock contributes to nearly 40 percent of total agricultural output in developed countries and 20 percent in developing ones, supporting the livelihoods of at least 1.3 billion people worldwide. 

Key fact 2 
Thirty-four percent of global food protein supply comes from livestock. 

Key fact 3 
Livestock consume annually about 6 billion tonnes of feed dry matter, about half being grass. Eighty-six percent of the global livestock feed intake is made of resources that are not edible by humans. Cereals represent about 13 percent of the intake, and about one third of global cereal production. 

Key fact 4 
Pastoralists promote rangeland health by improving soil fertility, conserving biodiversity, managing fires and accelerating nutrient cycling. 

Areas of work
The Organization supports member countries on different overlapping issues, including:
Animal genetic resource management
 implementing the Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources monitoring national breed populations;
 measuring progress towards SDG indicators 2.5.1 and 2.5.2;

Sustainable livestock production systems
 planning and implementing the sustainable development of the livestock sector by, for instance, supporting the preparation of livestock master plans to guide and implement investments and policies;
 improving livestock feeding systems, for example through enlarging the feed resource base, increasing feed safety, promoting the use of novel feed sources and related technologies, and reducing food-feed competition;
 providing guidance and technical assistance on good animal husbandry practices and animal welfare;
 reducing the use of antimicrobials in animal production;
 facilitating the implementation of animal identification and traceability, value-chain development, animal breeding programmes and livestock farmer field schools;

Livestock, climate change and natural resource use 

 enhancing the role of livestock in agroecosystems and evaluating the performance of agroecological systems;
 addressing the impacts of climate change on livestock, reducing the environmental footprint of livestock supply chains and assessing the impact of projects and investments on greenhouse gas emissions;

Pastoralism
 supporting pastoralist friendly-policies and regulations and participatory decision-making;
 supporting pastoral communities to build resilience by helping them to keep the short- and medium-term socio-economic, ecological and technical balances within and around pastoral systems.

FAOs statistical work
Sound and timely statistics are key to inform decisions, policies and investments that tackle issues related to food and agriculture, from hunger and malnutrition to rural poverty, from food systems productivity to the sustainable use of natural resources or to climate change.
FAO is dedicated to collecting, analysing, interpreting and disseminating food and agriculture statistics that are relevant for decision-making.
It is for this reason that developing and implementing methodologies and standards to assist countries in generating sound data and information is at the core of FAOs statistical work.
FAO also supports member countries in the collection, dissemination and uptake of data to formulate policies and plans or to better orient investments.

FAOs statutory bodies on statistics 
FAO has three statutory bodies on statistics, composed of senior statistics officials from member countries, which meet every two years:
 African Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS)
 Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS)
 Latin American and the Caribbean Commission for Agricultural Statistics (LACCAS)

Their role is to review the state of food and agricultural statistics in their respective region, to advise Members on the development and standardization of agricultural statistics within the general framework of FAOs work and to convene the study groups or other Subsidiary Bodies of national experts required for this purpose.
Quality standards and professional ethics 
FAO Statistics and Data Quality Assurance Framework (SDQAF, 2023) and the FAO Data and Statistical Standards Series adopted more recently, set out the principles and recommended best practices to ensure that FAO statistical production processes and statistical outputs are of the highest possible quality. The SQAF is based on the 
International collaboration 
FAO makes a significant contribution to global discussions related to food and agricultural statistics through its participation in international and regional statistical fora.
As the UN agency responsible for the development of methods and standards on food and agriculture statistics and for their implementation in countries, the Organization acts as the Secretariat of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Agricultural and Rural Statistics (UN-CEAG), the United Nations Expert Group on Food Security and Nutrition Data and Statistics (UN EG-FSN) and the Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP).
The Organization also participates in several Committee of experts and working groups under the 
Finally, FAO also co-organizes, in collaboration each time with a different member country, the International Conference on Agricultural Statistics (ICAS), which is held every three years under the auspices of the

A good global investment for the United Kingdom: How investing in CGIAR reduces global poverty and benefits U.K. citizens
CGIAR investments have delivered substantial economic benefits for the U.K. while reducing global poverty and food insecurity. CGIAR has boosted productivity on British farms, expanded export markets, and made food more affordable for British consumers. It has also helped prevent potential damage from pests and diseases that threaten U.K. farm livelihoods. CGIAR investments are likely to continue benefiting U.K. farmers in the future as the CGIARs provision of genetic material to the U.K. has increased over time. This paper quantifies the benefits to farmers, exporters and consumers.

A good global investment for the United States: How investing in CGIAR makes America stronger, safer and more prosperous
This report documents how CGIAR investments have delivered substantial economic, security, and diplomatic benefits for the U.S. that far exceed financial contributions. By driving agricultural innovation and providing evidence-based insights, CGIAR has boosted U.S. farm productivity, expanded export markets, and made food more affordable for American consumers. It has also helped prevent billions of dollars in potential damage from pests and diseases that threaten U.S. food security and farm livelihoods. CGIAR promotes American leadership in agricultural innovation by supplying the majority of the genetic materials used in U.S. crop breeding and acting as a critical research partner for U.S. businesses and universities. CGIAR also makes America safer and stronger through its work on predicting crises, protecting food security, and on improving livelihoods as an alternative to migration.

Estimating multidimensional development resilience
2026Lee, Seungmin; Abay, Kibrom A.; Barrett, Christopher B.; Hoddinott, John
X
Estimating multidimensional development resilience
Existing measures of resilience are typically based on a single well-being indicator. This is problematic in contexts where households face deprivations across multiple dimensions. We develop a multidimensional resilience measure, integrating probabilistic moment-based resilience measurement approaches with multidimensional poverty measurement methods. Applying these to household panel data from Ethiopia, we show that univariate and multidimensional resilience measures based on expenditure-based poverty, dietary diversity, and livestock asset holdings can yield varied inferences on the ranking of households as well as potential impact of development interventions. Univariate resilience measures constructed using consumption expenditure, dietary diversity and livestock asset holdings show distinct temporal and spatial distributional patterns. But while univariate measures are weakly correlated with one another and with different well-being metrics, multivariate measures exhibit much stronger rank correlations. When we contrast univariate measures of resilience to multidimensional measures of resilience, we find that the latter vary less over the study period; multidimensional resilience measures seem to capture more persistent or structural vulnerability and associated capacity of households. We also demonstrate the differences in these univariate and multivariate measures, including the potential of the composite multidimensional resilience measures for supporting targeting processes.

Making a Difference Blog Series

In 2014, IFPRI and the Gates Foundation launched the AReNA project to bridge agriculture and nutrition research, addressing data gaps and advancing understanding of how agriculture can better improve diets and nutrition worldwide.
The AReNA project created a one-of-a-kind dataset that links nutrition-related indicators to agricultural and environmental indicators. The dataset has been used for countless studies on the determinants of child stunting, wasting, and feeding practices.
AReNA was the first project to use the World Banks International Comparison Program (ICP) data on retail food pricescovering 175 countries and 800 food itemsto study the affordability of healthy and unhealthy diets. It significantly influenced the adoption of healthy diet metrics in FAO-led _State of Food Security and Nutrition_ reports and led to the widely-cited findingused by the FAO, World Bank, and othersthat 3 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet.

Following the Second Lead [](https:www.ipcc.ch20250917prfod1225)
The IPCC was created to provide policymakers with regular scientific assessments on climate change, its implications and potential future risks, as well as to put forward adaptation and mitigation options.
Through its assessments, the IPCC determines the state of knowledge on climate change. It identifies where there is agreement in the scientific community on topics related to climate change, and where further research is needed. The reports are drafted and reviewed in several stages, thus guaranteeing objectivity and transparency. The IPCC does not conduct its own research. IPCC reports are neutral, policy-relevant but not policy-prescriptive. The assessment reports are a key input into the international negotiations to tackle climate change. Created by the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988, the IPCC has 195 Member countries. In the same year, the UN General Assembly endorsed the action by WMO and UNEP in jointly establishing the IPCC.

Activities
The main activity of the IPCC is the preparation of reports assessing the state of knowledge of climate change. These include assessment reports, special reports and methodology reports. To deliver this work programme, the IPCC holds meetings of its government representatives, convening as plenary sessions of the Panel or IPCC Working Groups to approve, adopt and accept reports. Plenary Sessions of the IPCC also determine the IPCC work programme, and other business including its budget and outlines of reports. The IPCC Bureau meets regularly to provide guidance to the Panel on scientific and technical aspects of its work. The IPCC organizes scoping meetings of experts and meetings of lead authors to prepare reports. It organizes expert meetings and workshops on various topics to support its work programme, and publishes the proceedings of these meetings. To communicate its findings and explain its work, the IPCC takes part in outreach activities organized by the IPCC or hosted by other organizations, and provides speakers to other conferences. More information on sessions of the IPCC, its Working Groups and the Bureau can be found in the Documentation section.

Reports
The IPCC prepares comprehensive Assessment Reports about the state of scientific, technical and socio-economic knowledge on climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for reducing the rate at which climate change is taking place. It also produces Special Reports on topics agreed to by its member governments, as well as Methodology Reports that provide guidelines for the preparation of greenhouse gas inventories. The latest report is the Sixth Assessment Report which consists of three Working Group contributions and a Synthesis Report. The Working Group I contribution was finalized in August 2021, the Working Group II contribution in February 2022, the Working Group III contribution in April 2022 and the Synthesis Report in March 2023. 
The IPCC is currently in its seventh assessment cycle which formally began in July 2023 with elections of the new Chair and new IPCC and TFI Bureaus.

Working Groups and Task Force
IPCC assessments and special reports are prepared by three Working Groups, each looking at a different aspect of the science related to climate change: Working Group I (The Physical Science Basis), Working Group II (Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability), and Working Group III (Mitigation of Climate Change). The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, whose main objective is to develop and refine a methodology for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals. The Working Groups and Task Force handle the preparation of reports, selecting and managing the experts that work on them as authors. The activities of each Working Group and the Task Force are supported by their Technical Support Units (TSU).
Working Group I

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

 Land Conservation
 Wildlife

Seventy percent of the nations land is privately owned and conservation of our nations private lands not only results in healthy soil, water, air, plants, animals and ecosystems, it also provides productive and sustainable working lands.
Working with Individual Landowners on Conservation
USDA provides voluntary, incentive-based conservation to landowners through local field offices in nearly every county of the nation. USDA helped landowners develop conservation plans and enrolled a record number of acres of private working lands in conservation programs, working with more than 500,000 farmers and ranchers to implement conservation practices that clean the air we breathe, conserve and clean the water we drink, prevent soil erosion and create and protect wildlife habitat. USDA support - leveraged with historic outside investments - helped support producer incomes and reward them for their good work.
Learn more about conservation programs.
Promoting Landscape Scale Conservation
USDAs landscape-scale initiatives are making impacts on conservation priorities across entire landscapes by working with partners and landowners to deliver results. Work in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, the Mississippi River Basin, and Gulf of Mexico are among the initiatives that are applying the most effective conservation practices in the best places to increase agricultural and environmental returns. New science is helping to focus work in areas where we will generate 3-to-5 times the benefits of more general approaches - reducing problematic nutrients making it to rivers and streams by as much as 45.
Learn more about landscape conservation initiatives.
Promoting Good Health and Economic Vitality Through Outdoor Recreation
USDA-managed National Forests and Grasslands provide opportunities for over 165 million visitors each year to experience the wonders of nature and be physically active. These recreational uses also support an estimated 200,000 full and part time jobs and contribute almost 13 billion to local communities each year. Over the last two years, USDA has helped support more than 25 state public access programs and opened an estimated 2.4 million acres for hunting, fishing and other outdoor recreational opportunities on privately-owned lands. Additionally, almost 30 million in grants, provided through the Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, will help promote an estimated 35 percent increase in the number of participating landowners and increase outdoor recreation in these states by 21 percent.
USDA has enrolled more than one million acres of private working lands specifically to protect habitat for duck, pheasant, quail and other birds through continuous signup Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) initiatives. Along with the U.S. Department of Interior, USDA established a Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation (FICOR) to improve recreational access to federal lands across federal agencies and proposed a special 5 million set-aside in the Land and Water Conservation Fund to improve hunting and fishing access to federal lands.
Developing Regulatory Certainty and Promoting Ecosystem Services
Since 2009, USDA has awarded more than 200 conservation innovation grants to support exploration of new solutions to conservation. Also, the Working Lands for Wildlife Initiative helps farmers and ranchers conserve the habitat of seven species with declining populations. USDA reached a historic agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to provide certainty to landowners who implement and maintain certain conservation practices that protect specific species. This enables producers to continue to manage their lands even if the species is later added to the endangered species list.
Working with the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA is supporting States and others in efforts to establish water quality trading markets. This demonstrates the potential for farmers and ranchers to receive new revenue streams while delivering cost effective results for industries regulated under the greenhouse gas estimation guidelines and tools that assess greenhouse gas reductions and carbon sequestration resulting conservation, land management activities, and tree planting will also help farmers earn revenue for their work as they protect the environment.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

USDA works everyday to strengthen the American agricultural economy. Despite the difficult economic climate of the past years, our efforts - coupled with the 2008 Farm Bill, the Recovery Act, and the hard work and resilience of Americas farmers and ranchers - are helping American agriculture lead the nations recovery. We maintain a strong and appropriate safety net for Americas farmers, ranchers and growers which includes assistance to struggling industries, disaster assistance, and crop insurance, and provide technical assistance, access to credit, and help producers implement conservation practices.
To ensure that America remains the world leader in crop production, we conduct cutting-edge agricultural research. And to build a stronger agricultural economy for future generations, we work to improve both domestic and international markets, to create new income opportunities - like renewable energy - for Americas producers, and to grow the next generation of American farmers.
If youre new to farming and want to start a farm, start here. The New Farmers website offers a wealth of information and resources on how to start a farm, making a business plan, access to land and capital, risk management, taxes, safety, and more! Or take the shortcut and use the Discovery Tool where you can answer a few questions to get personalized information.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

 Research and Science

From fostering continued economic growth and opportunities for farmers and ranchers to addressing food security to preserving a safe, sustainable, affordable U.S. food and fiber system, the United States is a leader in global agriculture. Each day, the work of USDA scientists and researchers touches the lives of all Americans - from the farm to the kitchen table, from the forests to waterways, and from to the air we breathe to the energy that powers our country.
The challenges facing agriculture, natural resources, and conservation are immense and can be addressed through robust research and educational programs. USDA intramural and extramural science helps to protect, secure, and improve our food, agricultural and natural resources systems.
Strengthening Our Research System
USDA has refocused its science agencies to ensure the most effective and efficient use of its resources, while leveraging the strengths of our partners across the scientific community.
The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) coordinates USDA research, education and Extension activities with scientists and researchers across USDA, the federal government, and with university and private partners to make the best use of taxpayer investments.
The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is USDAs principal in-house research agency. ARS leads America towards a better future through agricultural research and information.
The Economic Research Service (ERS) anticipate trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America and conducts high-quality, objective economic research to inform decision making.
The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducts hundreds of surveys every year and prepares objective, timely statistical reports covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture.
The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) directs federal research funding to research that finds innovative solutions to issues related to agriculture, food, the environment, and communities through extramural research, Extension, and higher education.
AGARDA: A Vision for Disruptive Science to Confront Audacious Challenges
Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority (AGARDA) Implementation Strategy (PDF, 1.8 MB) is a framework outlining a new approach for delivering disruptive breakthrough discoveries for agriculture.
Enhancing the Productivity of American Agriculture and Ensuring the Safety of our Food Supply
USDA invests in research, development, and outreach of new varieties and technologies to mitigate animalplant diseases and increase productivity, sustainability, and product quality. USDA research has supported Americas farmers and ranchers in their work to produce a safe and abundant food supply for over 100 years. This work has helped feed the nation and sustain an agricultural trade surplus since the 1960s.
An additional focus is to establish more sustainable systems that enhance crop and animal health. Our scientists and university partners have revealed the genetic blueprints of a host of plants and animals including the genomes of apples, pigs, and turkeys, and in 2012, they furthered understanding of the tomato, bean, wheat and barley genomes -- key drivers in developing the resilience of those crops to feed growing populations.
NASS has developed animated avian influenza, mycobacterial disease, coccidiosis, campylobacterosis, mastitis and others.
USDA conducts and supports science that informs decisions and policies contributing to a safe food supply and the reduction of foodborne hazards. Our scientists found the primary site where the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease begins infection in cattle and developed an improved vaccine against the disease. They are also working on new strategies to control mites and other major honey bee problems such as colony collapse disorder.
Conserving Natural Resources and Combating Climate Change
USDA develops and delivers science-based knowledge that empowers farmers, foresters, ranchers, landowners, resource managers, policymakers, and Federal agencies to manage the risks, challenges, and opportunities of climate variability, and that informs decision-making and improves practices in environmental conservation.
Our scientists are developing rice and corn crops that are drought- and flood-resistant and helping to improve the productivity of soil, as well as production systems that require increasing smaller amounts of pesticides or none at all.
Vegetation indices contained in 
Additionally, our researchers have examined the potential impacts of a suite of climate scenarios on U.S. crop production. Studies like these will help policymakers, farmers, industry leaders and others better understand and adapt to a changing climate on Americas crop production.
Our researchers created 
USDA supports families managing through tough economic times by helping residents save energy at home and conserve water, with a program run by Cooperative Extension and our land-grant university partners. Cooperative Extension-affiliated volunteer monitoring programs have engaged citizens in water monitoring to better understand the effects of climate change andor aquatic invasive species on local waters. Collectively, these programs interacted with hundreds of local, State, and Federal partners. The programs help citizens detect the presence of invasive species and harmful algal blooms.
Science Education and Extension
USDA recognizes the importance of recruiting, cultivating, and developing the next generation of scientists, leaders, and a highly skilled workforce for food, agriculture, natural resources, forestry, environmental systems, and life sciences.
The NIFA interagency agreement with the 
USDA strives to provide effective research, education, and extension activities that inform public and private decision-making in support of rural and community development. NASS holds outreach events throughout the Census cycle with underserved and minority and disadvantaged farming groups to promote participation in the Census of Agriculture. With funding and support from NIFA, many Tribal Colleges are offering Reservation citizens training ranging from basic financial literacy to business start-up and marketing information so that families not only survive, but thrive.
In addition, the ERS Atlas of Rural and Small Town America brings together over 80 demographic, economic, and agricultural statistics for every county in all 50 states and assembles statistics in four broad categories -- people, jobs, agriculture, and geography.

Improving Nutrition and Confronting Obesity
USDA builds the scientific evidence for food-based and physical activity strategies and develops effective education activities to promote health and reduce malnutrition and obesity in children and high-risk populations. For instance, USDA Team Nutrition is an initiative of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service to support child nutrition programs through training and technical assistance for foodservice, nutrition education for children and their caregivers, and school and community support for healthy eating and physical activity.
USDA-supported research investigates the role of food in optimizing health throughout the life cycle for all Americans. In these efforts, USDAs Agricultural Research Services human nutrition researchers conduct scientific, evidence-based research that is the foundational base for the
