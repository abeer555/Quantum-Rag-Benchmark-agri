Since 1974, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has provided support to its member countries to make their research outputs visible and accessible through FAO AGRIS; one of the most comprehensive search engines in food and agricultural scientific literature providing free access to millions of bibliographic records in 123 different languages. 
FAO AGRIS facilitates the FAO AGRIS Network with up to hundreds of organizations worldwide contributing knowledge and data to the FAO AGRIS platform, resulting in a multilingual bibliographic collection of food and agricultural scientific research with special attention to scientific information produced in the global south. Therefore, AGRIS is used by whoever is inclined to find literature on any of FAOs areas of interest. 
Who provides the data in the FAO AGRIS database?
A network of organizations, known as data providers, provide the records indexed in the database. Ranging from academic and research institutions, development programmes, and international and national organizations to governmental bodies, libraries and publishers, these data providers comprise the FAO AGRIS Network. The FAO AGRIS Network also participates in knowledge sharing and capacity development activities. 
What kinds of records are indexed in the FAO AGRIS database?
The database indexes journal articles, monographs, books, book chapters, conference proceedings, grey literature (e.g., theses and dissertations, working papers, technical reports) and datasets on a range of topics pertaining to food and agriculture (FAOs thematic areas). 
Who uses the FAO AGRIS database?
The FAO AGRIS database is a free and invaluable resource for all those interested in agriculture and food, ranging from government officials, graduate students, lecturers, librarians and other information professionals to policymakers, practitioners in the agricultural sector, professional associations and publishers and researchers.
