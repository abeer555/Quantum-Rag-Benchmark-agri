Crops
The department provides advice to the Australian Government on cropping industries, including wheat and other grains, oilseeds, pulses, rice, sugar, cotton and seeds to support their continued development and growth. This involves liaison with industry, community and government, particularly through representative organisations and agencies.
The department monitors delivery of crops research and development by the Grains, Cotton, Rural Industries Research, Development Corporations and Sugar Research Australia Limited, which are accountable to the Australian Parliament through the Minister for Agriculture. The department works with these organisations to ensure that they meet government financial and accountability standards, including performance reporting.
The department also works with industry and other government agencies to improve market access and trade conditions for Australian exporters as well as managing Australias membership of the International Grains Council, the International Sugar Organisation and the International Cotton Advisory Committee.
