  Research and innovation for Brazilian agriculture 
The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (Embrapa) was established by the countrys federal government in 1973 to develop the technological foundation for a genuinely tropical model of agriculture and animal farming. The initiative has been tasked with providing Brazil with food security and a leading position in the international market for food, fiber and energy. Embrapa today is one of the largest agricultural research corporations of the world, with over half a century of contributions focused on innovation, efficiency, sustainability and social inclusion.
