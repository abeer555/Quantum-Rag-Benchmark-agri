Introduction 
Today, research and innovation in food, land and water systems are crucial for a sustainable, climate-resilient world free from hunger and malnutrition. New approaches are needed to ensure we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. A more integrated and impactful CGIAR is rising to the challenge, with a fresh portfolio of Initiatives to deliver a new 10-year strategy. 
 
Covering all research for development programming across CGIAR, the 2030 Research and Innovation Strategy provides an overview of how CGIAR will develop and deploy its capacities, assets, and skills to address priority global and regional challenges with partners over the decade.
