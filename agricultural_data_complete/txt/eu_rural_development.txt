The CAP Strategic Plans play an important role in advancing EU agriculture towards a more sustainable farming system. They contribute to fortify the rural socio-economic structures, strengthen farm incomes, and ensure food security. They also drive climate action, and help safeguard natural resources and enhance biodiversity.
The 28 CAP Strategic Plans underway: summary of implementation in 2023-24
At a glance
Each EU country elaborated its own CAP Strategic Plan (except Belgium which has one for Flanders and one for Wallonia).
The CAP Strategic Plans include the intervention strategies, and the CAP instruments each EU country will use from 2023 to 2027 to achieve the CAP objectives. They ensure coherence across the CAP instruments, and the strategic and complementary use of resources.
In total, EU countries have planned 2 500 interventions in their CAP Strategic Plans.
The CAP Strategic Plans and their amendments are approved by the European Commission, which supports the EU countries throughout the process. For their approval, the Commission also assesses whether they contribute to, and are consistent with, the EU legislation and commitments, including those laid out in the European Green Deal.
1 January 2023 marked the entry into force of the 2023-27 CAP and the beginning of the implementation of the CAP Strategic Plans.
