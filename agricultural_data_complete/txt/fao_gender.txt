We cannot end hunger and poverty without empowering both men and women in agrifood systems.
Today, agriculture and food systems face an unprecedented array of challenges. We must feed a growing global population in a context of emerging and persisting crises - economic, energy, environmental, food and social. These include conflicts, natural disasters, price volatility, market insecurity, mass migrations, health crises, and more, all of which are exacerbated by climate change, depletion of natural resources, rapid urbanization, shifts in dietary patterns and livelihood systems. 
Faced with these challenges, it is more important than ever to build inclusive, sustainable and resilient agrifood systems, so that the agricultural sector can perform to its full capacity and become more efficient. FAO recognizes that in order to achieve this, we must address the persisting inequalities that effect the underperformance of the agriculture sector in many countries. We need to work with and empower rural women, men, girls and boys.

The Year will spotlight the essential roles women play across agrifood systems, from production to trade, while often going unrecognized. Women farmers are central to food security, nutrition and economic resilience.
