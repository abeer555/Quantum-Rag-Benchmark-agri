Data centers

FAOSTAT
FAOSTAT provides free access to food and agriculture statistics (including crop, livestock, and forestry sub-sectors) for over 245 countries and territories and covers all FAO regional groupings from 1961 to the most recent year available. 

SDG Indicators
FAOs Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Data Portal provides access to the 22 SDG indicators under FAO custodianship as well as key information to support countries in tracking progress towards SDGs.

The Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) is an inter-agency platform to enhance food market transparency and policy response for food security. It provides market information on four grains particularly important in international food markets: wheat, maize, rice and soybeans.

Food and Agriculture Microdata Catalogue (FAM)
The Food and Agriculture Microdata (FAM) Catalogue provides access to micro datasets collected through farm and household surveys which contain information related to agriculture, food security and nutrition.

FAOs statistical work
Sound and timely statistics are key to inform decisions, policies and investments that tackle issues related to food and agriculture, from hunger and malnutrition to rural poverty, from food systems productivity to the sustainable use of natural resources or to climate change.
FAO is dedicated to collecting, analysing, interpreting and disseminating food and agriculture statistics that are relevant for decision-making.
It is for this reason that developing and implementing methodologies and standards to assist countries in generating sound data and information is at the core of FAOs statistical work.
FAO also supports member countries in the collection, dissemination and uptake of data to formulate policies and plans or to better orient investments.

FAOs statutory bodies on statistics 
FAO has three statutory bodies on statistics, composed of senior statistics officials from member countries, which meet every two years:
 African Commission on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS)
 Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS)
 Latin American and the Caribbean Commission for Agricultural Statistics (LACCAS)

Their role is to review the state of food and agricultural statistics in their respective region, to advise Members on the development and standardization of agricultural statistics within the general framework of FAOs work and to convene the study groups or other Subsidiary Bodies of national experts required for this purpose.
Quality standards and professional ethics 
FAO Statistics and Data Quality Assurance Framework (SDQAF, 2023) and the FAO Data and Statistical Standards Series adopted more recently, set out the principles and recommended best practices to ensure that FAO statistical production processes and statistical outputs are of the highest possible quality. The SQAF is based on the 
International collaboration 
FAO makes a significant contribution to global discussions related to food and agricultural statistics through its participation in international and regional statistical fora.
As the UN agency responsible for the development of methods and standards on food and agriculture statistics and for their implementation in countries, the Organization acts as the Secretariat of the United Nations Committee of Experts on Agricultural and Rural Statistics (UN-CEAG), the United Nations Expert Group on Food Security and Nutrition Data and Statistics (UN EG-FSN) and the Coordinating Working Party on Fishery Statistics (CWP).
The Organization also participates in several Committee of experts and working groups under the 
Finally, FAO also co-organizes, in collaboration each time with a different member country, the International Conference on Agricultural Statistics (ICAS), which is held every three years under the auspices of the
