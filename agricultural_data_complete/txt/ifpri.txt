Benchmarking LLMs for Agricultural Advisory: Insights from a Global Community of Practice 
As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in agricultural advisory services, there is growing recognition of the need for shared benchmarks to evaluate their performance, equity, and contextual relevance.

A good global investment for the United Kingdom: How investing in CGIAR reduces global poverty and benefits U.K. citizens
CGIAR investments have delivered substantial economic benefits for the U.K. while reducing global poverty and food insecurity. CGIAR has boosted productivity on British farms, expanded export markets, and made food more affordable for British consumers. It has also helped prevent potential damage from pests and diseases that threaten U.K. farm livelihoods. CGIAR investments are likely to continue benefiting U.K. farmers in the future as the CGIARs provision of genetic material to the U.K. has increased over time. This paper quantifies the benefits to farmers, exporters and consumers.

A good global investment for the United States: How investing in CGIAR makes America stronger, safer and more prosperous
This report documents how CGIAR investments have delivered substantial economic, security, and diplomatic benefits for the U.S. that far exceed financial contributions. By driving agricultural innovation and providing evidence-based insights, CGIAR has boosted U.S. farm productivity, expanded export markets, and made food more affordable for American consumers. It has also helped prevent billions of dollars in potential damage from pests and diseases that threaten U.S. food security and farm livelihoods. CGIAR promotes American leadership in agricultural innovation by supplying the majority of the genetic materials used in U.S. crop breeding and acting as a critical research partner for U.S. businesses and universities. CGIAR also makes America safer and stronger through its work on predicting crises, protecting food security, and on improving livelihoods as an alternative to migration.

Estimating multidimensional development resilience
2026Lee, Seungmin; Abay, Kibrom A.; Barrett, Christopher B.; Hoddinott, John
X
Estimating multidimensional development resilience
Existing measures of resilience are typically based on a single well-being indicator. This is problematic in contexts where households face deprivations across multiple dimensions. We develop a multidimensional resilience measure, integrating probabilistic moment-based resilience measurement approaches with multidimensional poverty measurement methods. Applying these to household panel data from Ethiopia, we show that univariate and multidimensional resilience measures based on expenditure-based poverty, dietary diversity, and livestock asset holdings can yield varied inferences on the ranking of households as well as potential impact of development interventions. Univariate resilience measures constructed using consumption expenditure, dietary diversity and livestock asset holdings show distinct temporal and spatial distributional patterns. But while univariate measures are weakly correlated with one another and with different well-being metrics, multivariate measures exhibit much stronger rank correlations. When we contrast univariate measures of resilience to multidimensional measures of resilience, we find that the latter vary less over the study period; multidimensional resilience measures seem to capture more persistent or structural vulnerability and associated capacity of households. We also demonstrate the differences in these univariate and multivariate measures, including the potential of the composite multidimensional resilience measures for supporting targeting processes.

Making a Difference Blog Series

In 2014, IFPRI and the Gates Foundation launched the AReNA project to bridge agriculture and nutrition research, addressing data gaps and advancing understanding of how agriculture can better improve diets and nutrition worldwide.
The AReNA project created a one-of-a-kind dataset that links nutrition-related indicators to agricultural and environmental indicators. The dataset has been used for countless studies on the determinants of child stunting, wasting, and feeding practices.
AReNA was the first project to use the World Banks International Comparison Program (ICP) data on retail food pricescovering 175 countries and 800 food itemsto study the affordability of healthy and unhealthy diets. It significantly influenced the adoption of healthy diet metrics in FAO-led _State of Food Security and Nutrition_ reports and led to the widely-cited findingused by the FAO, World Bank, and othersthat 3 billion people cannot afford a healthy diet.
