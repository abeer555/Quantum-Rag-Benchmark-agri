The Regeneration International Standard
The Regeneration International Standard has been crafted in a format that is more accessible for farmers, rather than adopting a regulatory standard format. The standard is mainly informative rather than normative. It includes the Definition, General Principles, Guidance, and clear Prohibitions. This separate Guidance Document is written to assist certifiers and operators in understanding how to comply with the standard.
OUR VISION
A healthy global ecosystem in which practitioners of regenerative agriculture and land use, in concert with consumers, educators, business leaders and policymakers, cool the planet, feed the world and restore public health, prosperity and peace on a global scale.
OUR WORK
We work with multiple stakeholders in key regions of the world who are committed to building alternative food and farming systems on a regional or national level. We are currently assisting in the building of numerous Regeneration Alliances, including those in South Africa, India, Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Canada, and in the Midwest region of the U.S.A.

If it comes straight from the farm, its unsafe. 
If it comes from a factory, its approved. 
Funny how that works, huh?

Must read book by Ronnie Cummins  André Leu  
Foreword by Vandana Shiva 
The Regenerative Agriculture Solution
...
Read this book to understand why you should care about regenerative agriculture. Until the public is better-informed and insists on sweeping changes to current agricultural policy . . . we will continue to degrade our planet and destabilize our climate. Leu and Cummins, through inspiring stories and solid science, show just how quickly we could turn that around. -Allan Savory, president, Savory Institute; chairman, Africa Centre for Holistic Management

Regeneration International
on Saturday
A growing number of wood industry certifications are designed to guide consumers to sustainably and ethically producing wood products. Theyre not perfect. Some have rules written by big timber. Almost all of them receive payments from companies seeking certifications. There is no seal that encompasses every issue, but dont let perfect be the enemy of good  even the most flawed badges have some baseline value.
