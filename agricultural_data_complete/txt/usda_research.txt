Senate Democrats have now voted 13 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats. They can continue to hold out for healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive critical nutrition assistance.

 Research and Science

From fostering continued economic growth and opportunities for farmers and ranchers to addressing food security to preserving a safe, sustainable, affordable U.S. food and fiber system, the United States is a leader in global agriculture. Each day, the work of USDA scientists and researchers touches the lives of all Americans - from the farm to the kitchen table, from the forests to waterways, and from to the air we breathe to the energy that powers our country.
The challenges facing agriculture, natural resources, and conservation are immense and can be addressed through robust research and educational programs. USDA intramural and extramural science helps to protect, secure, and improve our food, agricultural and natural resources systems.
Strengthening Our Research System
USDA has refocused its science agencies to ensure the most effective and efficient use of its resources, while leveraging the strengths of our partners across the scientific community.
The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) coordinates USDA research, education and Extension activities with scientists and researchers across USDA, the federal government, and with university and private partners to make the best use of taxpayer investments.
The Agricultural Research Service (ARS) is USDAs principal in-house research agency. ARS leads America towards a better future through agricultural research and information.
The Economic Research Service (ERS) anticipate trends and emerging issues in agriculture, food, the environment, and rural America and conducts high-quality, objective economic research to inform decision making.
The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) conducts hundreds of surveys every year and prepares objective, timely statistical reports covering virtually every aspect of U.S. agriculture.
The National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) directs federal research funding to research that finds innovative solutions to issues related to agriculture, food, the environment, and communities through extramural research, Extension, and higher education.
AGARDA: A Vision for Disruptive Science to Confront Audacious Challenges
Agriculture Advanced Research and Development Authority (AGARDA) Implementation Strategy (PDF, 1.8 MB) is a framework outlining a new approach for delivering disruptive breakthrough discoveries for agriculture.
Enhancing the Productivity of American Agriculture and Ensuring the Safety of our Food Supply
USDA invests in research, development, and outreach of new varieties and technologies to mitigate animalplant diseases and increase productivity, sustainability, and product quality. USDA research has supported Americas farmers and ranchers in their work to produce a safe and abundant food supply for over 100 years. This work has helped feed the nation and sustain an agricultural trade surplus since the 1960s.
An additional focus is to establish more sustainable systems that enhance crop and animal health. Our scientists and university partners have revealed the genetic blueprints of a host of plants and animals including the genomes of apples, pigs, and turkeys, and in 2012, they furthered understanding of the tomato, bean, wheat and barley genomes -- key drivers in developing the resilience of those crops to feed growing populations.
NASS has developed animated avian influenza, mycobacterial disease, coccidiosis, campylobacterosis, mastitis and others.
USDA conducts and supports science that informs decisions and policies contributing to a safe food supply and the reduction of foodborne hazards. Our scientists found the primary site where the virus that causes foot-and-mouth disease begins infection in cattle and developed an improved vaccine against the disease. They are also working on new strategies to control mites and other major honey bee problems such as colony collapse disorder.
Conserving Natural Resources and Combating Climate Change
USDA develops and delivers science-based knowledge that empowers farmers, foresters, ranchers, landowners, resource managers, policymakers, and Federal agencies to manage the risks, challenges, and opportunities of climate variability, and that informs decision-making and improves practices in environmental conservation.
Our scientists are developing rice and corn crops that are drought- and flood-resistant and helping to improve the productivity of soil, as well as production systems that require increasing smaller amounts of pesticides or none at all.
Vegetation indices contained in 
Additionally, our researchers have examined the potential impacts of a suite of climate scenarios on U.S. crop production. Studies like these will help policymakers, farmers, industry leaders and others better understand and adapt to a changing climate on Americas crop production.
Our researchers created 
USDA supports families managing through tough economic times by helping residents save energy at home and conserve water, with a program run by Cooperative Extension and our land-grant university partners. Cooperative Extension-affiliated volunteer monitoring programs have engaged citizens in water monitoring to better understand the effects of climate change andor aquatic invasive species on local waters. Collectively, these programs interacted with hundreds of local, State, and Federal partners. The programs help citizens detect the presence of invasive species and harmful algal blooms.
Science Education and Extension
USDA recognizes the importance of recruiting, cultivating, and developing the next generation of scientists, leaders, and a highly skilled workforce for food, agriculture, natural resources, forestry, environmental systems, and life sciences.
The NIFA interagency agreement with the 
USDA strives to provide effective research, education, and extension activities that inform public and private decision-making in support of rural and community development. NASS holds outreach events throughout the Census cycle with underserved and minority and disadvantaged farming groups to promote participation in the Census of Agriculture. With funding and support from NIFA, many Tribal Colleges are offering Reservation citizens training ranging from basic financial literacy to business start-up and marketing information so that families not only survive, but thrive.
In addition, the ERS Atlas of Rural and Small Town America brings together over 80 demographic, economic, and agricultural statistics for every county in all 50 states and assembles statistics in four broad categories -- people, jobs, agriculture, and geography.

Improving Nutrition and Confronting Obesity
USDA builds the scientific evidence for food-based and physical activity strategies and develops effective education activities to promote health and reduce malnutrition and obesity in children and high-risk populations. For instance, USDA Team Nutrition is an initiative of the USDA Food and Nutrition Service to support child nutrition programs through training and technical assistance for foodservice, nutrition education for children and their caregivers, and school and community support for healthy eating and physical activity.
USDA-supported research investigates the role of food in optimizing health throughout the life cycle for all Americans. In these efforts, USDAs Agricultural Research Services human nutrition researchers conduct scientific, evidence-based research that is the foundational base for the
