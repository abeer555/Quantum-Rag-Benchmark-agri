On the landscape level, P. ramorum's fast and often undetectable movement means that any treatment hoping to slow its spread must happen very early in the development of an infestation. Since P. ramorum's discovery, researchers have been working on the development of early detection methods on scales ranging from diagnosis in individual infected plants to landscape-level detection efforts involving large numbers of people. Detecting the presence of Phytophthora species requires laboratory confirmation. The traditional method of culturing is on a growth medium selective against fungi (and, in some cases, against other oomycetes such as Pythium species). Host material is removed from the leading edge of a plant tissue canker caused by the pathogen; resulting growth is examined under a microscope to confirm the unique morphology of P. ramorum. Successful isolation of the pathogen often depends on the type of host tissue and the time of year that detection is attempted. Because of these difficulties, researchers have developed some other approaches for identifying P. ramorum. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test can be the first step in nonculture methods of identifying P. ramorum, but it can only be a first step, because it detects the presence of proteins that are produced by all Phytophthora species. In other words, it can identify to the genus level, but not to the species level. ELISA tests can process large numbers of samples at once, so researchers often use it to screen out likely positive samples from those that are not when the total number of samples is very large. Some manufacturers produce small-scale ELISA \""field kits\"" that the homeowner can use to determine if plant tissue is infected by Phytophthora. Researchers have also developed numerous molecular techniques for P. ramorum identification. These include amplifying DNA sequences in the internal transcribed spacer region of the P. ramorum genome (ITS polymerase chain reaction, or ITS PCR); real-time PCR, in which DNA abundance is measured in real time during the PCR reaction, using dyes or probes such as SBYR-Green or TaqMan; multiplex PCR, which amplifies more than one region of DNA at the same time; and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), which uses the ITS DNA sequence amplified by the PCR reaction to differentiate Phytophthora species according to their"", ""Greek botrys (\u03b2\u03cc\u03c4\u03c1\u03c5\u03c2) meaning \""grapes\"", combined with the Neo-Latin suffix -itis for disease.

Synonyms for the sexual stage are: Hosts and symptoms Hosts The disease, gray mold, affects more than 200 dicotyledonous plant species and a few monocotyledonous plants found in temperate and subtropical regions, and potentially over a thousand species. Serious economic losses can be a result of this disease to both field and greenhouse grown crops. The causal agent, Botrytis cinerea can infect mature or senescent tissues, plants prior to harvest, or seedlings. There is a wide variety of hosts infected by this pathogen including protein crops, fiber crops, oil crops, and horticultural crops. Horticultural crops include vegetables (examples are chickpeas, lettuce, broccoli, and beans) and small fruit crops (examples are grape, strawberry, raspberry, and blackberry), these are most severely affected and devastated by gray mold. Plant organs affected include fruits, flowers, leaves, storage organs, and shoots. Symptoms and signs Symptoms vary across plant organs and tissues. B. cinerea is a soft rot that will have a collapsed and water soaked appearance on soft fruit and leaves. Brown lesions may develop slowly on undeveloped fruit. Twigs infected with gray mold will die back. Blossoms will cause fruit drop and injury, such as ridging on developing and mature fruit. Symptoms are visible at wound sites where the fungus begins to rot the plant. Gray masses with a velvety appearance are conidia on the plant tissues are a sign of plant pathogen. These conidia are asexual spores that will continue to infect the plant and surrounding hosts throughout the growing season making this a polycyclic disease. Plants can produce localized lesions when a pathogen attacks. An oxidative burst causes hypersensitive cell death called a hypersensitive response (HR). This soft rot can trigger HR to assist in colonization. Botrytis cinerea, as a necrotrophic pathogen, exploits the dead tissue for its pathogenicity or its ability to cause disease. Susceptible plants cannot use the HR to protect against B. cinerea. Biology Botrytis cinerea is characterized by abundant hyaline conidia (asexual spores) borne on grey, branching tree-like conidiophores. The fungus also produces highly resistant sclerotia as survival structures in older cultures. It overwinters as sclerotia or intact mycelia, both of which germinate in spring to produce conidiophores.

### **Identification of Plant Infections**

The provided text details different identification methods for *Botrytis cinerea* and *P. ramorum*, ranging from visual inspection in the field to advanced laboratory diagnostics.

#### **1. Identifying *Botrytis cinerea* (Gray Mold)**

This pathogen can be identified through its characteristic symptoms and signs on a wide variety of host plants, particularly vegetables (lettuce, beans) and small fruits (grapes, strawberries).

*   **Visual Symptoms:**
    *   **Soft Rot:** Infected tissues, like soft fruit and leaves, will have a ""collapsed and water soaked appearance.""
    *   **Lesions:** Brown lesions may develop on fruit.
    *   **Dieback:** Infected twigs will die back.
    *   **Blossom/Fruit Drop:** Infections on blossoms can lead to fruit drop.
*   **Physical Signs:**
    *   The most definitive sign is the presence of **""gray masses with a velvety appearance""** on plant tissues. These masses are the conidia (asexual spores) of the fungus.
*   **Microscopic Identification:** For a definitive biological confirmation, *Botrytis cinerea* is characterized by its abundant clear (hyaline) conidia, which are borne on gray, branching, tree-like structures called conidiophores.

#### **2. Identifying *Phytophthora ramorum***

Detecting *P. ramorum* is more complex and, according to the text, **requires laboratory confirmation**. Visual signs like cankers are mentioned, but these are not sufficient for positive identification.

*   **Traditional Lab Method (Culturing):**
    *   A sample of host material is taken from the ""leading edge of a plant tissue canker.""
    *   It is grown on a selective medium that inhibits the growth of fungi.
    *   The resulting growth is examined under a microscope to confirm the unique morphology of *P. ramorum*.
    *   **Limitations:** This method can be difficult, as its success depends on the type of host tissue and the time of year.

*   **Non-Culture Methods (For Screening and Confirmation):**
    *   **ELISA Test (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay):** This is often a first step. It detects proteins common to all *Phytophthora* species.
        *   **Function:** It can identify an infection to the genus level (*Phytophthora*), but **not** to the specific species level (*P. ramorum*).
        *   **Use:** It is very useful for screening large numbers of samples to quickly find likely positives. Small-scale ""field kits"" are also available for homeowners to test for the presence of *Phytophthora* in general.
    *   **Molecular (DNA-Based) Techniques:** These are used for precise, species-level identification.
        *   **ITS PCR:** Amplifies a specific DNA sequence in the *P. ramorum* genome.
        *   **Real-time PCR:** Measures the abundance of the pathogen's DNA during the reaction for a quantitative result.
        *   **Multiplex PCR:** Amplifies more than one DNA region simultaneously.
        *   **SSCP (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism):** Differentiates between *Phytophthora* species based on how their amplified DNA moves through a gel.

### **Treatment of Plant Infections**

The provided text contains very little information on specific treatment methods and focuses more on treatment strategy, almost exclusively for *P. ramorum*.

#### **1. Treating *Phytophthora ramorum***

The context emphasizes a proactive and strategic approach rather than detailing specific chemical or biological treatments.

*   **Prevention over Therapy:** ""Preventive treatments... are more effective than therapeutic treatments.""
*   **Critical Timing:** For landscape-level control, any treatment aiming to slow the spread ""must happen very early in the development of an infestation.""
*   **Knowledge-Based Application:** For individual prized trees, treatments depend on knowing the pathogen's movement through the landscape to predict when it is nearing the tree. This highlights the importance of the early detection methods mentioned above.

#### **2. Treating *Botrytis cinerea* (Gray Mold)**

The provided text **does not contain any information on how to treat infections** of *Botrytis cinerea*. It describes its biology—that it is a polycyclic disease spread by wind and overwinters as mycelia or hardy structures called sclerotia—but offers no management or treatment protocols.",iqp,8

Ammonium nitrate was found to produce better nitrogen absorption than urea, which performed better in low-temperature areas. Crop rotation Sunflower cultivation typically uses crop rotation, often with cereals, soybean, or rapeseed. This reduces idle periods and increases total sunflower production and profitability. Hybrids and cultivars In today's market, most of the sunflower seeds provided or grown by farmers are hybrids. Hybrids or hybridized sunflowers are produced by cross-breeding different types and species, for example cultivated sunflowers with wild species. By doing so, new genetic recombinations are obtained ultimately leading to the production of new hybrid species. These hybrid species generally have a higher fitness and carry properties or characteristics that farmers look for, such as resistance to pathogens. Hybrid, Helianthus annuus dwarf2 does not contain the hormone gibberellin and does not display heliotropic behavior. Plants treated with an external application of the hormone display a temporary restoration of elongation growth patterns. This growth pattern diminished by 35% 7\u201314 days after final treatment. Hybrid male sterile and male fertile flowers that display heterogeneity have a low crossover of honeybee visitation. Sensory cues such as pollen odor, diameter of seed head, and height may influence pollinator visitation of pollinators that display constancy behavior patterns. Sunflowers are grown as ornamentals in a domestic setting. Being easy to grow and producing spectacular results in any good, moist soil in full sun, they are a favourite subject for children.

It is closely related, but not identical, to the marrow; its fruit may be called marrow when mature. Ordinary zucchini fruit are any shade of green, though the golden zucchini is a deep yellow or orange. At maturity, they can grow to nearly 1 metre (3 feet) in length, but they are normally harvested at about 15\u201325 cm (6\u201310 in). In botany, the zucchini's fruit is a pepo, a berry (the swollen ovary of the zucchini flower) with a hardened epicarp. In cookery, it is treated as a vegetable, usually cooked and eaten as an accompaniment or savory dish, though occasionally used in sweeter cooking. Zucchini descend from squashes first domesticated in Mesoamerica over 7,000 years ago, but the zucchini itself was bred in Milan in the late 19th century. Zucchini occasionally contain toxic cucurbitacins, making them extremely bitter, and causing severe gastro-enteric upsets. Causes include stressed growing conditions, and cross pollination with ornamental squashes. Etymology and common names The term zucchini is the plural of zucchino, a diminutive of zucca, meaning \""gourd\"", \""marrow\"", \""pumpkin\"" or \""squash\"" in Italian. The word exists in both feminine (zucchina, pl. zucchine) and masculine (zucchino, pl. zucchini) forms, the first being standard Italian and the second a Tuscan variant. The original Italian text of Pellegrino Artusi's 1891 cookbook La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiar bene (Science in the Kitchen and the Art of Eating Well) uses the feminine form, but The Oxford Companion to Italian Food observes that \""North Americans prefer the version zucchini\"".

As with many other plant viruses, one of the most promising methods to control TYLCV is the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV.

It is aphid transmitted. Definition Banana bunchy top is a viral disease caused by a single-stranded DNA virus called the banana bunchy top virus (BBTV). It was first identified in Fiji in 1879, and has spread around the world since then. Like many viruses, BBTV was named after the symptoms seen, where the infected plants are stunted and have \""bunchy\"" leaves at the top. The disease is transmitted from plant-to-plant in tropical regions of the world by aphids, banana aphids which can also feed on Heliconia and flowering ginger (from the family Zingiberaceae), which is an important factor in control of the disease. There are no resistant varieties, so controlling the spread by vectors and plant materials are the only management methods. Transmission All babuviruses are aphid transmitted including BBTV. Information is lacking regarding vector-virus interactions. Host and symptoms Banana bunchy top disease affects the banana fruit and foliage, and is caused by a single-strand DNA virus, the banana bunchy top virus. BBTV can infect species of the family Musaceae, which includes bananas, plantains, abaca, and more. The aphids also feed on Heliconia and flowering ginger, which are grown in the same regions as bananas and must be considered in management of the disease. It is best to establish a banana production area where these alternate hosts are not present. Any age plants can be infected by this virus, but some varieties of banana, including the Cavendish, are more susceptible to the virus.

The provided context does not contain a comprehensive guide to the best practices for organic tomato cultivation. The information is highly specific, focusing almost exclusively on methods to control the spread of one particular disease, the **Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)**.

Based on this limited information, the following practices for managing this specific viral threat in tomatoes can be identified:

*   **Plant Resistant/Tolerant Varieties:** The text explicitly states that a key method to control the spread of TYLCV is ""planting resistant/tolerant lines."" This is a primary, non-chemical strategy that aligns with organic principles.
*   **Implement Crop Rotation:** ""Crop rotation"" is listed as another method to control the spread of the virus. This is a fundamental practice in organic agriculture for managing soil health and breaking disease cycles.
*   **Utilize Breeding for Resistance:** The text mentions ""breeding for resistance of TYLCV"" as a control strategy. For an organic grower, this means selecting and purchasing seeds from breeding programs that develop disease-resistant varieties through traditional, non-transgenic methods.

The text also mentions two other control methods, but it's important to note their relationship with organic standards:

*   **Insecticides:** The document notes that insecticides are used as a control strategy, particularly in developing countries where they are costly. For organic cultivation, growers would need to use certified organic insecticides and prioritize preventative, non-chemical methods first.
*   **Transgenic Plants:** The text describes ""the production of transgenic tomato plants resistant to TYLCV"" as ""one of the most promising methods"" for control. However, the use of transgenic (genetically modified) organisms is prohibited under most organic certification standards.

In summary, the provided information is insufficient to detail comprehensive best practices for organic tomato cultivation. It lacks any information regarding soil preparation, fertilization, irrigation, weed management, or control of other common pests and diseases. The only actionable advice is related to disease management for TYLCV, which involves selecting resistant varieties and practicing crop rotation.",amplitude,8

Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War. The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states: I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty. Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon, the Greek word for both \""apple\"" and fruit in general), who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.

It is high in protein, vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, and iron. Bangladesh and other countries in Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific mainly use jute for its fiber. Tossa jute fiber is softer, silkier, and stronger than white jute. This variety shows good sustainability in the Ganges Delta climate. Along with white jute, tossa jute has also been cultivated in the soil of Bengal where has been known as paat since the start of the 19th century. Coremantel, Bangladesh, is the largest global producer of the tossa jute variety. In India, West Bengal is the largest producer of jute. History Jute has been used for making textiles in the Indus valley civilization since the 3rd millennium BC. For centuries, jute has been a part of the culture of Bangladesh and some parts of West Bengal and Assam. The British started trading in jute during the seventeenth century. During the reign of the British Empire, jute was also used in the military. British jute barons grew rich by processing jute and selling manufactured products made from it.

Breadfruit, however, exudes latex upon harvesting, causing the plant sap to adhere to the surface, leading to the staining of the epicarp. Proper methods of breadfruit harvesting usually include the process of draining the latex and disposing of it. Sticky white sap or latex is present in all parts of the breadfruit tree and has been used for glue, caulk, and even chewing gum. Native Hawaiians used its sticky latex to trap birds, whose feathers were made into cloaks. In culture On Puluwat in the Caroline Islands, in the context of sacred yitang lore, breadfruit (poi) is a figure of speech for knowledge. This lore is organized into five categories: war, magic, meetings, navigation, and breadfruit. According to an etiological Hawaiian myth, the breadfruit originated from the sacrifice of the war god K\u016b. After deciding to live secretly among mortals as a farmer, K\u016b married and had children. He and his family lived happily until a famine seized their island. When he could no longer bear to watch his children suffer, K\u016b told his wife that he could deliver them from starvation, but to do so he would have to leave them. Reluctantly she agreed, and at her word, K\u016b descended into the ground right where he had stood until only the top of his head was visible. His family waited around the spot he had last been, day and night, watering it with their tears until suddenly, a small green shoot appeared where K\u016b had stood. Quickly, the shoot grew into a tall and leafy tree that was laden with heavy breadfruits that K\u016b's family and neighbors gratefully ate, joyfully saved from starvation. It also known as a symbol of abundance and famine relief Many breadfruit hybrids and cultivars are widely distributed throughout the Pacific though they are seedless or otherwise biologically incapable of naturally dispersing long distances. It is therefore clear that humans aided distribution of the plant in the Pacific, specifically prehistoric groups who colonized the Pacific Islands.

It can also result in sediments and other pollutants being washed into aquatic habitats, which can result in a wide range of environmental issues, including eutrophication and acidification. Sugarcane cultivation can also result in soil compaction, which is caused by the use of heavy, infield machinery. Along with impacting invertebrate and fauna within the upper layers of the soil, compaction can also lead to decreased porosity. This in turn can increase surface runoff, resulting in greater leaching and erosion. Habitat destruction Due to the large quantity of water required, sugarcane cultivation heavily relies on irrigation. Additionally, since large amounts of soil are removed with the crop during harvest, significant washing occurs during the processing phase. In many countries, such as India and Australia, this requirement has placed a strain on available resources, requiring the construction of barrages and other dams. This has altered the amount of water reaching aquatic habitats, and has contributed to the degradation of ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef and Indus Delta. Sugarcane has also contributed to habitat destruction through the clearance of land. Seven countries around the world devote more than 50% of their land to the cultivation of sugarcane. Sugarcane fields have replaced tropical rain forests and wetlands. While the majority of this clearance occurred in the past, expansions have occurred within the past couple decades, further contributing to habitat destruction. Mitigation efforts A wide variety of mitigation efforts can be implemented to reduce the impacts of sugarcane cultivation. Among these efforts is switching to alternative irrigation techniques, such as drip irrigation, which are more water efficient. Water efficiency can also be improved by employing methods such as trash mulching, which has been shown to increase water intake and storage. Along with reducing the overall water use, this method can also decrease soil runoff, and therefore prevent pollutants from entering the environment. In areas with a slope greater than 11%, it is also recommended that zero tillage or cane strip planting are implemented to help prevent soil loss. Sugarcane processing produces a wide variety of pollutants, including heavy metals and bagasse, which can be released into the environment through wastewater discharge. To prevent this, alternative treatment methods such as high rate anaerobic digestions can be implemented to better treat this wastewater. Stormwater drains can also be installed to prevent uncontrolled runoff"", ""in nurseries has also focused on disinfesting irrigation water containing P. ramorum inoculum. Irrigation water can become infested from bay trees in the forest (if the irrigation source is a stream), from bay trees overhanging irrigation ponds, from runoff from infested forests, or from recirculated irrigation water. Experiments in Germany with three types of filters\u2014slow sand filters, lava filters, and constructed wetlands\u2014showed that the first two removed P. ramorum from the irrigation water completely, while 37% of the post-treatment water samples from the constructed wetland still contained P. ramorum. Along with proper irrigation practices, ground cover can be an effective management practice for ornamental plants in nursery settings. Covering the ground with a 5 to 7 cm layer of gravel can prevent splash dispersal of propagules onto ornamental plants that are grown in containers. This practice can also significantly suppress the disease. Since P. ramorum can persist for an undetermined period of time within the soil profile, management programs in nurseries should also deal with delineating the pathogen's distribution in nursery soil and eliminating it from infested areas. A variety of chemical options has been tested for soil disinfestation, including such chemicals as chloropicrin, metham sodium, iodomethane, and dazomet. Lab tests indicated that all of these chemicals were effective when applied to infested soil in glass jars. Additionally, tests on volunteer nurseries with infested soil demonstrated that dazomet (trade name Basamid) fumigation followed by a 14-day tarping period successfully removed P. ramorum from the soil profile. Other soil disinfestation practices under investigation, or in which interest has been expressed, include steam sterilization, solarization, and paving of infested areas. General sanitation in infested areas One of the most important aspects of P. ramorum control involves interrupting the human-mediated movement of the pathogen by ensuring that infested materials do not move from location to location. While enforceable quarantines perform part of this function, basic cleanliness when working or recreating in infested areas is also important. In most cases, cleanliness practices involve ridding potentially infested surfaces\u2014such as shoes, vehicles, and pets\u2014of foliage and mud before leaving the infested area. The demands of implementing these practices become more complex when large numbers of people are working in infested areas, as in construction, timber harvesting, or wildfire suppression. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and USDA Forest Service have implemented guidelines and mitigation requirements for the latter two situations; basic information about cleanliness"", ""2008, a group of nursery industry organizations issued a list of BMPs that includes subsections on pest prevention/management, training, internal/external monitoring/audits, records/traceability, and documentation. The document includes such specific recommendations as \""Avoid overhead irrigation of high-risk plants\""; \""After every crop rotation, disinfect propagation mist beds, sorting area, cutting benches, machines and tools to minimize the spread or introduction of pathogens\""; and \""Nursery personnel should attend one or more P. ramorum trainings conducted by qualified personnel or document self-training\"". Research on control of P. ramorum in nurseries has also focused on disinfesting irrigation water containing P. ramorum inoculum. Irrigation water can become infested from bay trees in the forest (if the irrigation source is a stream), from bay trees overhanging irrigation ponds, from runoff from infested forests, or from recirculated irrigation water. Experiments in Germany with three types of filters\u2014slow sand filters, lava filters, and constructed wetlands\u2014showed that the first two removed P. ramorum from the irrigation water completely, while 37% of the post-treatment water samples from the constructed wetland still contained P. ramorum. Along with proper irrigation practices, ground cover can be an effective management practice for ornamental plants in nursery settings. Covering the ground with a 5 to 7 cm layer of gravel can prevent splash dispersal of propagules onto ornamental plants that are grown in containers. This practice can also significantly suppress the disease.

The context offers several strategies, primarily drawn from the sections on sugarcane cultivation and nursery management.

**1. Switch to More Efficient Irrigation Techniques:**
*   The text explicitly recommends **drip irrigation** as a more water-efficient alternative to traditional methods. This technique delivers water directly to the base of the plants, minimizing loss from evaporation and runoff.

**2. Employ Water-Conserving Farming Methods:**
*   **Trash mulching** is highlighted as a method that can improve water efficiency. It works by increasing water intake into the soil and enhancing the soil's water storage capacity. This practice reduces the overall amount of water needed for irrigation and also decreases soil runoff.

**3. Adjust Irrigation Practices Based on Plant Type:**
*   For nursery settings, one of the specific Best Management Practices (BMPs) listed is to ""**Avoid overhead irrigation of high-risk plants**."" Overhead irrigation can be inefficient, with significant water loss to evaporation, and this recommendation suggests using more targeted methods to conserve water, especially for certain types of plants.

In summary, the provided text suggests reducing water usage in irrigation by adopting more efficient technologies like drip irrigation, using soil-enhancing practices like trash mulching to improve water retention, and avoiding inefficient methods such as overhead irrigation where possible.",angle,8

Tomatoes are also grown using hydroponics. Picking and ripening To facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with the plant hormone ethylene. At industrial scale, such as for canning, tomatoes are picked mechanically. The machine cuts the whole vine and uses sensors to separate ripe tomatoes from the rest of the plant, which is returned to the farm for use either as green manure or to be grazed by livestock. Production In 2023, world production of tomatoes was 192 million tonnes, led by China with 36% of the total, followed by India, Turkey, and the United States as secondary producers (table). Pests and diseases Pests Common tomato pests include the tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, Tuta absoluta (tomato leafminer), slugs, and Colorado potato beetles. The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant. After an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone. This activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects. The hormone was first identified in tomatoes. Diseases Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants. A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus. Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants. A serious disease is curly top, carried by the beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle. As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally. Bacterial wilt is another common disease impacting yield. Wang et al., 2019 found phage combination therapies to reduce the impact of bacterial wilt, sometimes by reducing bacterial abundance and sometimes by selecting for resistant but slow growing genetics.

Nutrition A raw tomato is 95% water, 4% carbohydrates, and less than 1% each of fat and protein (table). In a reference amount of 100 grams (3.5 oz), raw tomatoes supply 18 calories and 16% of the Daily Value of vitamin C, but otherwise have low micronutrient content (table). Effects on health The US Food and Drug Administration has determined there is little credible evidence that tomatoes or tomato-based foods reduce the risk of various types of cancer. In a 2011 scientific review, the European Food Safety Authority concluded that lycopene did not favorably influence DNA, skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation, heart function or vision. Toxins The leaves, stem, and green unripe fruit of the tomato plant contain small amounts of the alkaloid tomatine. They contain small amounts of solanine, a toxic alkaloid found in larger amounts in potato leaves and other members of the nightshade family. Tomato plants can be toxic to dogs if they eat large amounts of the fruit, or chew plant material. Small amounts of tomato foliage are sometimes used for flavoring, and the green fruit of unripe red tomato varieties is sometimes used for cooking, particularly as fried green tomatoes. Salmonella outbreaks Tomatoes have been linked to multiple Salmonella food poisoning outbreaks in the US.

The provided text does not contain a complete guide to ""organic tomato cultivation."" However, it offers several key pieces of information relevant to practices that are central to an organic approach, particularly in the areas of pest and disease management and soil health.

Here is a summary of the best practices that can be inferred from the context:

### **Disease Management**

*   **Cultivar Selection:** A primary strategy for disease management is selecting the right type of tomato plant. The text states, ""Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants."" An organic grower should prioritize choosing cultivars known for their resistance to common local diseases.
*   **Preventing Virus Transmission:** Be aware of how diseases are transmitted. For example, ""tobacco mosaic virus"" can be transmitted to tomato plants by handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products. Strict sanitation and hygiene are crucial.
*   **Vector Control:** Some diseases are spread by insects. ""Curly top"" is carried by the beet leafhopper. Managing this pest is key to preventing the disease.
*   **Biological Controls:** For diseases like ""bacterial wilt,"" the text mentions advanced biological therapies. It notes that ""phage combination therapies"" can be used to reduce the impact of the disease, which aligns with organic principles of using natural systems to manage problems.

### **Pest Management**

*   **Pest Identification:** The first step in management is knowing the threats. The text identifies numerous common tomato pests, including: tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms, tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, Tuta absoluta (tomato leafminer), slugs, and Colorado potato beetles.
*   **Understanding Plant Defenses:** The document explains that after an insect attack, tomato plants naturally produce ""systemin,"" a hormone that activates defensive mechanisms like protease inhibitors to slow insect growth. An organic approach would focus on maintaining plant health to ensure these natural defenses function optimally.

### **Soil and Plant Management**

*   **Green Manure:** In the context of industrial harvesting, the text mentions that leftover plant material ""is returned to the farm for use either as green manure or to be grazed by livestock."" Using plant matter as green manure is a fundamental organic practice for improving soil structure and fertility.

In summary, while the provided information does not offer a step-by-step guide to organic tomato cultivation, it emphasizes critical organic principles such as **proactive disease and pest management through cultivar selection, sanitation, understanding natural plant defenses, and the use of green manure to build soil health.** It lacks specific details on topics like organic fertilizers, crop rotation, soil preparation, or companion planting.",angle,8

The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers, and fruit, possibly killing the plant. After an insect attack tomato plants produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone. This activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects. The hormone was first identified in tomatoes. Diseases Tomato cultivars vary widely in their resistance to disease. Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants. A common tomato disease is tobacco mosaic virus. Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants. A serious disease is curly top, carried by the beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle. As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the top leaves of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally. Bacterial wilt is another common disease impacting yield. Wang et al., 2019 found phage combination therapies to reduce the impact of bacterial wilt, sometimes by reducing bacterial abundance and sometimes by selecting for resistant but slow growing genetics.

The provided context does not contain a comprehensive guide to ""organic tomato cultivation."" However, it does offer several key pieces of information regarding pest and disease management and soil health that would be integral to an organic approach.

Here is what can be gleaned from the text:

**1. Disease Management**

*   **Cultivar Selection:** A critical practice is selecting the right tomato variety. The text notes, ""Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants."" An organic grower would benefit from choosing cultivars known for their resistance to common local diseases.
*   **Preventing Transmission:** Simple sanitation is crucial. To prevent the spread of **tobacco mosaic virus**, growers should avoid handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products around tomato plants.
*   **Biological Controls:** For **bacterial wilt**, a serious disease, the text mentions a 2019 study by Wang et al. that found ""phage combination therapies to reduce the impact."" Phage therapy is a biological control method that uses viruses to target specific bacteria, which aligns with organic principles.

**2. Pest Management**

*   **Understanding Natural Defenses:** The text explains that tomato plants have their own defensive mechanisms. When attacked by insects, they ""produce systemin, a plant peptide hormone... which activates defensive mechanisms, such as the production of protease inhibitors to slow the growth of insects."" While not a practice the grower performs, understanding and supporting this natural plant health is a cornerstone of organic farming.
*   **Identifying Pests:** The first step in management is identification. The text provides a list of common tomato pests to be aware of, including:
    *   Tomato bug and stink bugs
    *   Cutworms, tomato hornworms, and tobacco hornworms
    *   Aphids and cabbage loopers
    *   Whiteflies and tomato fruitworms
    *   Flea beetles and red spider mite
    *   *Tuta absoluta* (tomato leafminer) and slugs
    *   Colorado potato beetles
    *   Tomato russet mite (*Aculops lycopersici*)

**3. Soil Management**

*   **Green Manure:** The text mentions a practice used in industrial-scale harvesting where the non-fruit parts of the plant are ""returned to the farm for use either as green manure or to be grazed by livestock."" Using leftover plant matter as **green manure** is a key organic practice to return nutrients and organic matter to the soil.

**Limitations of the Provided Information:**
The supplied context does not contain enough information to fully answer the question about the best practices for organic tomato cultivation. Crucial topics that are **not covered** include:
*   Organic soil preparation and fertilization (e.g., composting, cover crops).
*   Specific organic-approved pesticides or fungicides.
*   Practices like crop rotation, companion planting, or mulching.
*   Organic weed and water management techniques.",angle,8

The provided text does not offer a complete guide to the ""best practices for organic tomato cultivation."" It focuses more on general production, common pests and diseases, and the industrial handling of tomatoes. However, it does contain some relevant information that can be applied to or inform an organic cultivation strategy, particularly in the areas of pest and disease management.

Here is what can be gleaned from the context:

**1. Cultivar Selection:**
*   The text notes that ""Modern hybrids focus on improving disease resistance over the heirloom plants."" For an organic grower, selecting cultivars with strong natural resistance to common local diseases is a critical first step, as it reduces the need for interventions later.

**2. Pest Management:**
The text identifies numerous pests that an organic grower would need to manage:
*   **Common Pests:** Tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, *Tuta absoluta* (tomato leafminer), slugs, and Colorado potato beetles.
*   **Natural Plant Defenses:** The document mentions that after an insect attack, tomato plants naturally produce `systemin`, a hormone that activates defense mechanisms like protease inhibitors to slow insect growth. An organic approach would seek to support and enhance these natural plant defenses.

**3. Disease Management:**
The text identifies several key diseases and some management principles:
*   **Tobacco Mosaic Virus:** A key practice to prevent this common disease is to avoid transmitting it from tobacco products. The text states, ""Handling cigarettes and other infected tobacco products can transmit the virus to tomato plants."" This is a crucial, non-chemical preventative measure.
*   **Curly Top:** This disease is carried by the beet leafhopper. Management in an organic system would focus on controlling the insect vector.
*   **Bacterial Wilt:** The text mentions a specific biological control method: ""Wang et al., 2019 found phage combination therapies to reduce the impact of bacterial wilt."" This use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) is a non-chemical, biological control strategy that aligns with organic principles.

**4. Soil Management:**
*   **Green Manure:** In its description of industrial harvesting, the text mentions that the non-fruit part of the plant ""is returned to the farm for use either as green manure or to be grazed by livestock."" Using plant matter as green manure is a common and important practice in organic farming to build soil health and fertility.

Several strains of TSWV have been detected in countries such as Australia, Spain, and the United States that can overcome the Sw-5-resistant gene. However, those strains of TSWV have not been spread worldwide, so the Sw-5 gene is still useful. Other important prevention techniques include buying virus- and thrips-free transplants and managing thrips populations. Introducing species that naturally prey on thrips, such as the minute pirate bugs (Orius insidiosus) and big-eyed bugs (Geocoris punctipes), may help reduce transmission of TSWV. Insecticides are not an efficient way to decrease the vector population because the vectors rapidly develop resistance. Removing weeds and infected plants is a good way to prevent more infections in the greenhouse. Sanitation practices such as the destruction or removal of old crops by plowing or physical removal are often used in the field. References External links Media related to Tomato spotted wilt virus at Wikimedia Commons Data related to Tomato spotted wilt orthotospovirus at Wikispecies ## Potato spindle tuber viroid The potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd, Pospiviroid fusituberis) was the first viroid to be identified. PSTVd is a small, single stranded circular RNA molecule closely related to the chrysanthemum stunt viroid. Present within the viroidal RNA is the Pospiviroid RY motif stem loop common to its genus. The natural hosts are potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum). All potatoes and tomatoes are susceptible to PSTVd and there is no form of natural resistance. Natural infections have also been seen in avocados and infections in other solanaceous crops have been induced in the laboratory. Until 2017 PSTVd was thought to be unable to infect Solanum sisymbriifolium. Then in May seeds exported by a Dutch company were noticed to be infected. These seeds were shipped from the company, but had been originally bred to their specifications in two Asian countries. Pstv also causes Tomato bunchy top and is seed transmitted in tomato. it contains single stranded RNA without protein coat. Discovery It was discovered by Theodor Otto Diener, who is a plant pathologist at the U.S Department of Agriculture's Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, and discovered it in 1971. He named it viroid because it is 1/80th size of a virus. Strains and their symptoms"", ""the fungus, stressed plants, often brought on by environmental changes, are easier to attack than healthy plants, so any conditions that will stress the plant but not directly harm the Verticillium will be beneficial for Verticillium wilt development. Management Verticillium wilt begins as a mild, local infection, which over a few years will grow in strength as more virile strains of the fungus develop. If left unchecked the disease will become so widespread that the crop will need to be replaced with resistant varieties, or a new crop will need to be planted altogether. Control of Verticillium can be achieved by planting disease\u2013free plants in uncontaminated soil, planting resistant varieties, and refraining from planting susceptible crops in areas that have been used repeatedly for solanaceous crops. Soil fumigation can also be used, with chloropicrin being particularly effective in reducing disease incidence in contaminated fields. In tomato plants, the presence of ethylene during the initial stages of infection inhibits disease development, while in later stages of disease development the same hormone will cause greater wilt. Tomato plants are available that have been engineered with resistant genes that will tolerate the fungus while showing significantly lower signs of wilting. Verticillium albo-altrum, V. dahliae and V. longisporum can overwinter as melanized mycelium or microsclerotia within live vegetation or plant debris. As a result, it can be important to clear plant debris to lower the spread of disease. V. dahliae and V. longisporum are able to survive as microsclerotia in soil for up to 15 years. Importance Verticillium wilt occurs in a broad range of hosts but has similar devastating effects on many of these plants. In general, it reduces the quality and quantity of a crop by causing discoloration in tissues, stunting, and premature defoliation and death. Stock from infested nurseries may be restricted. Once a plant is infected, there is no way to cure it. Verticillium wilt is especially a concern in temperate areas and areas that are irrigated. Verticllium spp. can naturally occur in forest soils and when these soils are cultivated, the pathogen will infect the crop. The Salinas Valley in California has had severe problems with Verticillium wilt since 1995, most likely due to flooding in the winter of 1995. Many areas in the Salinas and Pajaro Valleys are unable to grow lettuce due to the high levels of Verticillium dahliae in the soil. Potatoes grown in Verticillium infested"", ""requires fine tuning, but may be feasible. Breeders strive to produce tomato plants with improved yield, shelf life, size, and resistance to environmental pressures, including disease. These efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various fruit attributes. For instance, linkage drag, the introduction of an undesired trait during backcrossing, has altered the metabolism of the fruit. This trait is physically close to the desired allele along the chromosome. Breeding for traits like larger fruit has thus unintentionally altered nutritional value and flavor. Breeders have turned to wild tomato species as a source of alleles to introduce beneficial traits into modern varieties. For example, wild relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids (associated with greater sugar content), or resistance to diseases such as to the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani. However, this tactic has limitations, since selection for traits such as pathogen resistance can negatively impact other favorable traits such as fruit production. Cultivation The tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars. Hydroponic and greenhouse cultivation Greenhouse tomato production in large-acreage commercial greenhouses and owner-operator stand-alone or multiple-bay greenhouses is increasing, providing fruit during those times of the year when field-grown fruit is not readily available. Smaller fruit (cherry and grape), or cluster tomatoes (fruit-on-the-vine) are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner-operator growers. Tomatoes are also grown using hydroponics. Picking and ripening To facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with the plant hormone ethylene. At industrial scale, such as for canning, tomatoes are picked mechanically. The machine cuts the whole vine and uses sensors to separate ripe tomatoes from the rest of the plant, which is returned to the farm for use either as green manure or to be grazed by livestock.

The provided context does not contain enough information to fully answer how modern tomato hybrids specifically aid in *organic farming*, as the term ""organic farming"" and its specific practices or regulations are not mentioned. However, the text provides significant detail on how modern tomato breeding and the resulting varieties help reduce the need for disease control in general agriculture.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the relevant information:

### How Modern Tomato Varieties Help Reduce Disease Control

The primary way modern tomato varieties help reduce the need for disease control is through **genetic resistance** to specific pathogens. Breeders introduce resistance traits, often from wild tomato species, into modern cultivars.

1.  **Resistance to Fungal Diseases (Verticillium Wilt):**
    *   The text explicitly states that a key management strategy for Verticillium wilt is to plant **""resistant varieties.""**
    *   It further explains that ""Tomato plants are available that have been engineered with **resistant genes** that will tolerate the fungus while showing significantly lower signs of wilting."" This directly reduces the need for other control methods like soil fumigation with chemicals such as chloropicrin.

2.  **Resistance to Viral Diseases (Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus - TSWV):**
    *   The text highlights the **`Sw-5-resistant gene`** as a crucial tool for managing TSWV. While some strains of the virus have evolved to overcome this gene, it is still considered useful and effective in many regions, thereby reducing the reliance on other control measures like managing thrips populations.

3.  **The General Breeding Process for Resistance:**
    *   The information confirms that breeders actively seek out disease resistance. It notes, ""Breeders have turned to wild tomato species as a source of alleles to introduce beneficial traits into modern varieties.""
    *   A specific example is given: sourcing resistance ""to diseases such as to the early blight pathogen **Alternaria solani**.""

### Limitations and Gaps in the Provided Information

*   **Pest Control:** The provided text **does not contain any information** on how modern tomato hybrids help control insect pests (e.g., tomato hornworms, aphids, thrips, whiteflies). The control methods mentioned for pests are biological (introducing predators like minute pirate bugs) or cultural (sanitation), not genetic resistance in the tomato plant itself.
*   **Diseases with No Known Resistance:** For some diseases, genetic resistance is not an option. The text clearly states that for the **Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd)**, ""All potatoes and tomatoes are susceptible to PSTVd and there is no form of natural resistance."" In this case, modern hybrids offer no advantage, and farmers must rely entirely on other methods.
*   **Unintended Consequences:** The text points out a significant drawback to breeding for resistance called **""linkage drag.""** This is where introducing a desired trait like pathogen resistance can ""negatively impact other favorable traits such as fruit production"" or alter the fruit's metabolism, flavor, and nutritional value.

In summary, based on the provided text, modern tomato varieties significantly reduce the need for disease control measures by incorporating genetic resistance to specific fungal and viral pathogens like *Verticillium wilt*, *Tomato spotted wilt virus*, and *Alternaria solani*. However, this benefit does not extend to all diseases, and the text provides no evidence that it aids in controlling insect pests.",angle,8

Pstv also causes Tomato bunchy top and is seed transmitted in tomato. it contains single stranded RNA without protein coat. Discovery It was discovered by Theodor Otto Diener, who is a plant pathologist at the U.S Department of Agriculture's Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland, and discovered it in 1971. He named it viroid because it is 1/80th size of a virus. Strains and their symptoms"", ""the fungus, stressed plants, often brought on by environmental changes, are easier to attack than healthy plants, so any conditions that will stress the plant but not directly harm the Verticillium will be beneficial for Verticillium wilt development. Management Verticillium wilt begins as a mild, local infection, which over a few years will grow in strength as more virile strains of the fungus develop. If left unchecked the disease will become so widespread that the crop will need to be replaced with resistant varieties, or a new crop will need to be planted altogether. Control of Verticillium can be achieved by planting disease\u2013free plants in uncontaminated soil, planting resistant varieties, and refraining from planting susceptible crops in areas that have been used repeatedly for solanaceous crops. Soil fumigation can also be used, with chloropicrin being particularly effective in reducing disease incidence in contaminated fields. In tomato plants, the presence of ethylene during the initial stages of infection inhibits disease development, while in later stages of disease development the same hormone will cause greater wilt. Tomato plants are available that have been engineered with resistant genes that will tolerate the fungus while showing significantly lower signs of wilting. Verticillium albo-altrum, V. dahliae and V. longisporum can overwinter as melanized mycelium or microsclerotia within live vegetation or plant debris. As a result, it can be important to clear plant debris to lower the spread of disease. V. dahliae and V. longisporum are able to survive as microsclerotia in soil for up to 15 years. Importance Verticillium wilt occurs in a broad range of hosts but has similar devastating effects on many of these plants. In general, it reduces the quality and quantity of a crop by causing discoloration in tissues, stunting, and premature defoliation and death. Stock from infested nurseries may be restricted. Once a plant is infected, there is no way to cure it. Verticillium wilt is especially a concern in temperate areas and areas that are irrigated. Verticllium spp. can naturally occur in forest soils and when these soils are cultivated, the pathogen will infect the crop. The Salinas Valley in California has had severe problems with Verticillium wilt since 1995, most likely due to flooding in the winter of 1995. Many areas in the Salinas and Pajaro Valleys are unable to grow lettuce due to the high levels of Verticillium dahliae in the soil. Potatoes grown in Verticillium infested"", ""requires fine tuning, but may be feasible. Breeders strive to produce tomato plants with improved yield, shelf life, size, and resistance to environmental pressures, including disease. These efforts have yielded unintended negative consequences on various fruit attributes. For instance, linkage drag, the introduction of an undesired trait during backcrossing, has altered the metabolism of the fruit. This trait is physically close to the desired allele along the chromosome. Breeding for traits like larger fruit has thus unintentionally altered nutritional value and flavor. Breeders have turned to wild tomato species as a source of alleles to introduce beneficial traits into modern varieties. For example, wild relatives may possess higher amounts of fruit solids (associated with greater sugar content), or resistance to diseases such as to the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani. However, this tactic has limitations, since selection for traits such as pathogen resistance can negatively impact other favorable traits such as fruit production. Cultivation The tomato is grown worldwide for its edible fruits, with thousands of cultivars. Hydroponic and greenhouse cultivation Greenhouse tomato production in large-acreage commercial greenhouses and owner-operator stand-alone or multiple-bay greenhouses is increasing, providing fruit during those times of the year when field-grown fruit is not readily available. Smaller fruit (cherry and grape), or cluster tomatoes (fruit-on-the-vine) are the fruit of choice for the large commercial greenhouse operators while the beefsteak varieties are the choice of owner-operator growers. Tomatoes are also grown using hydroponics. Picking and ripening To facilitate transportation and storage, tomatoes are often picked unripe (green) and ripened in storage with the plant hormone ethylene. At industrial scale, such as for canning, tomatoes are picked mechanically. The machine cuts the whole vine and uses sensors to separate ripe tomatoes from the rest of the plant, which is returned to the farm for use either as green manure or to be grazed by livestock. Production In 2023, world production of tomatoes was 192 million tonnes, led by China with 36% of the total, followed by India, Turkey, and the United States as secondary producers (table). Pests and diseases Pests Common tomato pests include the tomato bug, stink bugs, cutworms, tomato hornworms and tobacco hornworms, aphids, cabbage loopers, whiteflies, tomato fruitworms, flea beetles, red spider mite, Tuta absoluta (tomato leafminer), slugs, and Colorado potato beetles. The tomato russet mite, Aculops lycopersici, feeds on foliage and young fruit of tomato plants, causing shrivelling and necrosis of leaves, flowers,""]","Based on the agricultural information provided, here is a comprehensive answer to your question.

Modern tomato breeding and the development of resistant varieties play a significant role in reducing the need for disease control, which is a core principle of organic farming. The provided text details how this is achieved primarily through genetic resistance to specific pathogens.

Here’s how modern tomato varieties help:

**1. Breeding for Specific Disease Resistance:**
The text highlights that breeders actively work to produce tomato plants with resistance to diseases. This is a key non-chemical strategy for disease management.

*   **Verticillium Wilt:** The context explicitly states that control of this fungal disease can be achieved by ""planting resistant varieties."" It further mentions, ""Tomato plants are available that have been engineered with resistant genes that will tolerate the fungus while showing significantly lower signs of wilting."" This directly reduces the need for soil fumigants like chloropicrin, which would not be used in organic farming.
*   **Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV):** The text describes the ""Sw-5-resistant gene"" as a useful tool for managing this virus. By planting varieties with this gene, the plant can initiate a hypersensitive response, killing cells around the infection and stopping the virus from replicating and spreading. This genetic trait replaces the need for other control methods.
*   **Early Blight (Alternaria solani):** The text notes that breeders turn to wild tomato relatives to find alleles for beneficial traits, including ""resistance to diseases such as to the early blight pathogen Alternaria solani.""

**2. Sourcing Resistance from Wild Relatives:**
The information points out that breeders use wild tomato species as a source for beneficial alleles. This allows them to introduce natural resistance into modern tomato varieties without relying on chemical applications. This practice aligns with organic principles of using natural systems and biodiversity.

### Limitations and Missing Information

While the provided text strongly supports the role of modern varieties in disease control, it also contains important limitations and gaps in information regarding the question:

*   **No Information on Pest Resistance:** The text does **not** contain any information about modern tomato hybrids being bred for resistance to insect pests like tomato hornworms, aphids, whiteflies, or stink bugs. The pest control methods mentioned are biological (introducing predators like pirate bugs) or physical (removing weeds), not genetic resistance in the tomato plant itself.
*   **Not All Diseases Have a Genetic Solution:** The text provides a clear counterexample with the **Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd)**, stating, ""All potatoes and tomatoes are susceptible to PSTVd and there is no form of natural resistance."" This shows that breeding is not a universal solution for every pathogen.
*   **Resistance Can Be Overcome:** The effectiveness of genetic resistance is not always permanent. The text notes that several strains of TSWV have been detected that can ""overcome the Sw-5-resistant gene,"" meaning this line of defense can be breached by evolving pathogens.
*   **Negative Trade-offs in Breeding:** The context warns of ""unintended negative consequences"" from breeding. The effort to breed for one trait, like disease resistance, can negatively impact others. The text mentions ""linkage drag"" and that selection for pathogen resistance can ""negatively impact other favorable traits such as fruit production.""

In summary, based on the provided text, modern tomato breeding significantly helps reduce the need for disease control in farming by incorporating genetic resistance to key fungal and viral pathogens like **Verticillium wilt, Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus, and Early Blight**. This is a crucial tool for organic farming, which avoids synthetic chemical inputs. However, the text does **not** provide evidence for breeding resistance to common insect pests, and it highlights that genetic solutions are not available for all diseases and can come with agronomic trade-offs.",angle,8

Several strains of TSWV have been detected in countries such as Australia, Spain, and the United States that can overcome the Sw-5-resistant gene. However, those strains of TSWV have not been spread worldwide, so the Sw-5 gene is still useful. Other important prevention techniques include buying virus- and thrips-free transplants and managing thrips populations. Introducing species that naturally prey on thrips, such as the minute pirate bugs (Orius insidiosus) and big-eyed bugs (Geocoris punctipes), may help reduce transmission of TSWV. Insecticides are not an efficient way to decrease the vector population because the vectors rapidly develop resistance. Removing weeds and infected plants is a good way to prevent more infections in the greenhouse. Sanitation practices such as the destruction or removal of old crops by plowing or physical removal are often used in the field.

Ammonium nitrate was found to produce better nitrogen absorption than urea, which performed better in low-temperature areas. Crop rotation Sunflower cultivation typically uses crop rotation, often with cereals, soybean, or rapeseed. This reduces idle periods and increases total sunflower production and profitability. Hybrids and cultivars In today's market, most of the sunflower seeds provided or grown by farmers are hybrids. Hybrids or hybridized sunflowers are produced by cross-breeding different types and species, for example cultivated sunflowers with wild species. By doing so, new genetic recombinations are obtained ultimately leading to the production of new hybrid species. These hybrid species generally have a higher fitness and carry properties or characteristics that farmers look for, such as resistance to pathogens. Hybrid, Helianthus annuus dwarf2 does not contain the hormone gibberellin and does not display heliotropic behavior. Plants treated with an external application of the hormone display a temporary restoration of elongation growth patterns. This growth pattern diminished by 35% 7\u201314 days after final treatment. Hybrid male sterile and male fertile flowers that display heterogeneity have a low crossover of honeybee visitation. Sensory cues such as pollen odor, diameter of seed head, and height may influence pollinator visitation of pollinators that display constancy behavior patterns. Sunflowers are grown as ornamentals in a domestic setting. Being easy to grow and producing spectacular results in any good, moist soil in full sun, they are a favourite subject for children.

Sunflower seeds can be processed into a peanut butter alternative, sunflower butter. It is also sold as food for birds and can be used directly in cooking and salads. Native Americans had multiple uses for sunflowers in the past, such as in bread, medical ointments, dyes and body paints. Sunflower oil, extracted from the seeds, is used for cooking, as a carrier oil and to produce margarine and biodiesel, as it is cheaper than olive oil.

Disease management Breeding of resistant varieties is the most cost-effective method to control this rust. Fungicides are available but vary in availability depending on their registration restrictions by national or state governments. Development of varieties resistant to the disease is always an important objective in wheat breeding programs for crop improvement. This has been done in the past, however as normal, these resistance genes became ineffective due to the acquisition of virulence to that particular resistance gene rendering the variety susceptible - necessitating ongoing variety development. Resistance genes These genes are most often abbreviated Yr and Yr1, Yr24, etc. QYr.niab-2D.1 is a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for adult plant resistance (APR). This allele comes from the Claire variety. Bouvet et al., 2021 discovered it when investigating unknown resistance in the UK 2015 and 2016 seasons. It has since broken down however.

The provided context contains information that explains how modern hybrids can help reduce the need for pest and disease control, which is particularly relevant for organic farming. The answer can be constructed by combining the general principles of hybridization mentioned in the sunflower section with the specific tomato disease information.

### How Modern Hybrids Reduce the Need for Disease Control

The texts indicate that modern hybrids help reduce the need for disease control primarily through the incorporation of genetic resistance to specific pathogens.

1.  **Principle of Hybridization for Resistance:** The section on sunflowers explains the core concept. It states that hybrids are created by cross-breeding different plant types to produce ""new genetic recombinations."" A primary goal of this process is to create hybrid species that ""carry properties or characteristics that farmers look for, such as resistance to pathogens.""

2.  **Specific Example in Tomatoes:** The text provides a direct example of this principle in tomatoes with the **Sw-5 gene**, which confers resistance to the **Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus (TSWV)**. Plants with this gene can initiate a ""hypersensitive response,"" where cells surrounding an infection die off, depriving the virus of the ability to replicate and spread. By breeding tomato varieties that carry the Sw-5 gene, farmers can grow crops that have a built-in defense mechanism, reducing the need for external treatments.

3.  **Relevance to Organic Farming:** This genetic resistance is a cornerstone of disease management that aligns perfectly with organic farming principles. Organic farming restricts the use of synthetic pesticides and fungicides. The text notes that for TSWV, chemical control is already challenging, as ""insecticides are not an efficient way to decrease the vector population because the vectors rapidly develop resistance."" Therefore, having a plant with innate genetic resistance from hybridization is a more effective and sustainable strategy that avoids prohibited chemical inputs.

### Limitations and Nuances Mentioned in the Text

The provided information also highlights important limitations, indicating that hybridization is not a complete solution:

*   **Resistance is Not Universal:** The text clearly states that for the **Potato Spindle Tuber Viroid (PSTVd)**, which also infects tomatoes, ""there is no form of natural resistance."" This means that hybridization has not yet provided a solution for every disease, and farmers must still rely on other management practices like sourcing clean seed and sanitation.
*   **Pathogens Can Overcome Resistance:** Genetic resistance is not always permanent. The text notes that several strains of TSWV have been detected that can ""overcome the Sw-5-resistant gene."" This concept is reinforced in the wheat rust section, which explains that resistance genes can become ineffective as pathogens evolve, ""necessitating ongoing variety development."" While the Sw-5 gene is still considered useful, this shows a constant need for breeders to develop new hybrids with new resistance genes.

### Conclusion

In summary, based on the provided texts, modern tomato hybrids reduce the need for pest and disease control in organic farming by incorporating **specific resistance genes (like Sw-5 for TSWV)**. This allows the plant to defend itself naturally, decreasing the reliance on external controls like insecticides, which are often inefficient and restricted in organic systems. However, the information also makes it clear that this genetic resistance is **not available for all diseases (e.g., PSTVd)** and can be **overcome by evolving pathogens**, requiring continuous efforts in plant breeding.",amplitude,8
