TEMPERATURE CHANGE (DEGREE CELSIUS) 348 ix FOREWORD Timely, accurate and high-quality data and statistics are the cornerstone of solid policy design, where decisions are based on hard evidence, and monitoring and evaluation rely on strong statistical systems. This has become all the more critical as governments around the world commit to major sectoral and national development plans, as well as regional and global development agendas. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic, while hampering national capacities to collect data, has emphasized the pressing need for data and statistics to inform timely responses and monitor trends. Statistical work has been at the core of FAOs activities and mandate since the Organization was founded in 1945, supporting its Members in eliminating hunger, improving nutrition, eradicating rural poverty, and promoting inclusive and efficient agricultural and food systems. FAO is a leading provider of internationally comparable data on food, nutrition and agriculture, which are gathered from national statistical offices and its network of partner agencies, and harmonized to paint a global picture. All of these data are summarized in this Statistical Yearbook. The FAO Statistical Yearbook was revamped in 2020 on the occasion of FAOs 75th anniversary, underscoring the importance that FAO assigns to data and statistics as a global public good at the core of our efforts to advance sustainable development. In 2021 the publication has been consolidated as a primary tool and indispensable reference for policy makers, researchers and analysts, as well as laypersons interested in the past, present and future paths of food and agriculture. Drawing on the wealth of information that FAO statisticians produce across the Organization, this publication, prepared by the Statistics Division, offers a synthesis of the major factors at play in the global food and agricultural landscape. Statistics are presented in four thematic chapters, covering the economic importance of agricultural activities; inputs, outputs and factors of production; their implications for food security and nutrition; and their impacts on the environment. This Statistical Yearbook is only one of a series of tools and statistical publications that FAO provides to users. The freely accessible FAOSTAT data platform contains the largest statistical database on food and agriculture in the world, with approximately 20 000 indicators covering more than 245 countries and territories, and around 2 000 000 users each year. The Statistical Yearbook is accompanied by the shorter Statistical Pocketbook, which provides a quick and easy reference to the main facts and trends in food and agriculture. In addition to compiling and disseminating data, FAO is also involved in strengthening the statistical capacity of countries in order to produce more and better data; setting standards and methodologies; and leveraging big data innovations. FAO is committed to ensuring free access to current, reliable, timely and trusted data, necessary to chart a course towards a more sustainable agriculture and a world free of hunger. José Rosero Moncayo Director, Statistics Division x ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This statistical yearbook was prepared by the Statistics Division (ESS) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with the Communications (OCC), Fisheries and Aquaculture (NFI), Forestry (NFO), Land and Water (NSL) and Markets and Trade (EST) divisions. Olivier Lavagne dOrtigue led the work under the direction of José Rosero Moncayo (ESS Director). We would like to thank the following for their contributions and input: Iana Arkhipova, Veronica Boero, Carlo Cafiero, Giulia Conchedda, Piero Conforti, Christophe Duhamel, Adrienne Egger, Juan Feng, Laura Galeotti, Chiara Gnetti, Amanda Gordon, Leman Yonca Gürbüzer, Dominique Habimana, Irina Kovrova, Suzanne Lapstun, Eun Jeong Lee, Xinman Liu, Livia Lombardi, Jeannie Marshall, Patricia Mejias Moreno, Javier Montero-Serrano, Jean-Marie Munyeshyaka, Griffiths Obli Laryea, Kimberly Sullivan, Salar Tayyib, Francesco Tubiello, Monica Umena, Stefania Vannuccini, Michele Vollaro, Sven Walter and Nathan Wanner. xi HOW TO USE THIS YEARBOOK THE STRUCTURE The Statistical Yearbook 2021 is divided into four thematic chapters:  Chapter 1 (Economic dimensions of agriculture) provides an overview of agriculture, forestry and fishing from an economic standpoint.  Chapter 2 (Production, trade and prices of commodities) presents the outputs of the sector in terms of the production and trade of the different commodities and the evolution of prices.  Chapter 3 (Food security and nutrition) looks at how some of these outputs are consumed by narrowing the focus on food security and nutrition.  Chapter 4 (Sustainability and environmental aspects of agriculture) deals with the impacts of the sector as a whole on the environment. Each chapter draws on the latest available data to describe through text and charts the trends since the early 2000s. As data on each topic are produced according to different schedules and with different methods and sources, the latest year available can change between sections.COUNTRY DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION The country classification adopted in this publication is based on the United Nations M49 classification (https:unstats.un.orgunsd methodologym49). The country names have been abbreviated in the data tables and figures. The official Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) names can be found at http:www.fao.orgnocsen. AGGREGATIONS Regional and subregional aggregates are based on the country groupings defined in the United Nations M49 classification. A small subset of indicators used in Part 3 is based on the aggregation rules defined in The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2021 report (https:doi.org10.4060cb4474en). Two types of aggregations are used: sum and weighted mean. A sufficiency condition is imposed when computing the aggregation  the aggregation is computed only when enough countries have reported data, and the current threshold is set at 50 percent of the variable and the weighting variable, if present. DATA PRESENTATION CONVENTIONS The cut-off date for the data is 1 October 2021.  When country data have not been reported for the reference year, an asterisk () on the year label indicates that the value for the most recent year available is shown. For example, 20172019 means that the most recent value for the period from 2017 to 2019 is shown.  A billion is 1 000 million.  A trillion is 1 000 billion.  In data tables:  A blank means that data are not available or that aggregates cannot be calculated because of missing data for the years shown.  0 or 0.0 means zero or a number that is small enough to round to zero at the displayed number of decimal places.  2.5 means a proportion less than 2.5 percent.  0.1 means less than 100 000 people.

This represents an increase of USD 1.5 trillion compared with 2000. In Africa, the value added more than doubled over the period, increasing from USD 170 billion to USD 404 billion. Given its size, Asia was the main contributor to Source: FAOSTAT Note: Percentages on the figure indicate the shares in the total; they may not tally due to rounding. https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig01Source: FAOSTAT https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig02FIGURE 1. VALUE ADDED OF AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING BY REGIONFIGURE 2. SHARE OF AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING VALUE ADDED IN TOTAL GDP BY REGION (USD 2015 PRICES)global agriculture, forestry and fishing value added with 64 percent of the world total in 2019: the continent shows an increase of 84 percent, from USD 1.2 trillion in 2000 to USD 2.2 trillion in 2019. The Americas and Europe present an increase of 52 percent and 19 percent respectively in the 20002019 period, while Oceania increased its agricultural value added by just 9 percent, having seen it decline since 2016. The countries with the largest agriculture, forestry and fishing sector in terms of value added in 2019 are China, India and the United States of America (see Table 1). As non-agricultural activities outpaced agriculture, the global contribution of agriculture to gross domestic product (GDP) declined, which is expected to accompany the growth of total GDP (see Figure 2). The share of value added from agriculture, forestry and fishing fell between 2000 and 2019 in all regions except Africa: from 1.8 percent in 2000 to 2000 2005 2010 2015 20190.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0USD trillion, 2015 prices Asia Americas Africa Europe Oceania14 8 16 6010 12 14 64 a As defined in the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC) Revision 4, agriculture, forestry and fishing includes crop and animal production, hunting and related service activities, forestry and logging, and fishing and aquaculture.2000 2005 2010 2015 20190246810121416 Percentage Africa Asia World Oceania Americas Europe WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 20212 FIGURE 4. CROPLAND AREA BY REGIONFACTORS OF PRODUCTION  Land and Water In 2019, the global agricultural land area was 4.8 billion hectares (ha), down 3 percent, or 0.13 billion ha compared with 2000 (see Figure 3 and Table 3). Between 2000 and 2019, roughly two-thirds of agricultural land were used for permanent meadows and pastures (3.2 billion ha in 2019), which declined by 6 percent (0.19 billion ha). One- third of the total agricultural land was cropland (1.6 billion ha in 2019), which increased by 4 percent (0.06 billion ha). Although agricultural land decreased since 2000, it increased on average by 0.1 percent each year over the 19612019 period, with a significant expansion up to the 1990s.1 The regional breakdown of the global cropland area varied marginally between 2000 and 2019 (see Figure 4). Asia had the largest share of the global cropland area in 2019 (38 percent), followed by the Americas (24 percent), Europe (19 percent), Africa (18 percent) and Oceania (2 percent). Nonetheless, there were differences in cropland expansion in the different regions during this period  Oceania and Africa both had rapid growth in cropland area (24 percent and 20 percent, respectively), while Asia had more moderate growth (5 percent). Approximately 30 percent of global cropland and permanent meadows and pastures can be found in three countries (see Figure 5), which are not necessarily the ones with the largest country area.b In 2019, 12 percent of global permanent meadows and pastures belonged to China, 10 percent to Australia, and 8 percent to the United States of America. For the same year, the largest share of global cropland was in India (11 percent), followed by the United States of America (10 percent) and China (9 percent). Extensive grasslands 1.6 percent in 2019 in Europe, from 10.3 percent to 7.1 percent in Asia, and from 3.9 percent to 2.6 percent in Oceania (it remained virtually unchanged in the Americas at 1.8 percent). It rose in Africa from 14.3 percent to 15.6 percent over the period, but with a marginal decline between 2018 and 2019. This trend, which is seldom observed, is due to increases in the GDP share of agriculture in a number of countries  Algeria, Angola, Benin, Chad, the Congo, Eritrea, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Morocco, the Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Togo. These countries account for about half the total value added from agriculture, forestry and fishing in Africa in 2019 (see Table 2). Despite its relatively small economic size, the sector plays a crucial role in the agro-industry value chain and in the use of natural resources. As such, agriculture affects the quality of the environment and food security beyond what its contribution to GDP indicates.

WORLD AGRICULTURAL LAND BY USE AND MAIN COUNTRIES (2019)versus croplands in agricultural land can indicate intensified livestock practices as opposed to the harvesting of crops. Cropland area per capita decreased in all regions between 2000 and 2019 as population increased faster than cropland (see Figure 6). The world average declined by 17 percent to 0.20 ha per capita in 2019; the decrease was the largest in Africa (-26 percent, to 0.21 ha per capita), followed by the Americas (-18 percent, to 0.36 ha per capita), Asia (-15 percent, to 0.13 ha per capita), Europe (-8 percent, to 0.39 ha per capita) and Oceania (-7 percent, to 0.79 ha per capita). Against this backdrop, the increase in agricultural production over the same period (described in Chapter 2) indicates higher efficiency in feeding the population with limited land resources. The countries with the highest cropland area per capita are Kazakhstan, Australia and Canada (see Table 4), due to vast areas of land available over sparsely populated areas. Other reasons for high values include the intense use of agricultural inputs over cropland and dependencies on agricultural imports or food aid. The development of irrigation is one aspect of agriculture intensification that has allowed total production to grow much faster than the cultivated area. The global land area equipped for irrigation reached 342 million ha in 2019 (see Figure 7), an increase of 18 percent from the 289 million ha of 2000 and more than twice the 1960s land area equipped for irrigation.2 The vast majority is located in Asia (70 percent), where irrigation was a key component of the green revolution;3 the Americas account for 16 percent and Europe for 8 percent of the world total. As shown in Table 5, China (75 million ha) and India (70 million ha) have the largest equipped area for irrigation, far ahead of the United States of America (27 million ha). China and India also have the largest net gains in equipped area between 2000 and 2019 (21 million ha for China and 10 million ha for India). All the regions except Europe saw increases in the area equipped for irrigation, with Africa growing the fastest (25 percent), followed by Oceania (23 percent) and Asia (20 percent). The share of equipped area for irrigation in agricultural land increased to 7.2 percent in 2019, up 1.3 percentage points compared with 2000 (see Figure 8). It increased in all regions, with the larger gains located in Asia as described above. The higher levels in Asia compared to the rest of the world are partly attributable to the prevalence of irrigation-intensive rice cultivation in the region.

On the other hand, irrigated agriculture competes with other uses of the water resources available in countries. The share of agricultural water withdrawals in total withdrawals is an indication of the relative weight of agricultural water uses compared to the industrial and municipal ones. As seen in Figure 9, the countries with the highest shares are located mostly in Africa and Asia, with the share of Somalia above 99 percent. One trait shared by most of these countries is the income level: out of the top 20 countries, the World Bank classifies six as low-income and 11 as lower-middle income while the remaining three belong to the upper-middle income group.5 In 2018, the share of agricultural water withdrawals in total withdrawals was greater than 90 percent in 31 countries (see Table 7).  Labour The number of people working in agriculture worldwide, including forestry and fishing, went down 17 percent in the 20002020 period, reaching 874 million in 2020, or 173 million less than in 2000 (see Figure 10). Agricultural employment has declined from approximately 800 million people to roughly 590 million in Asia: this means that more than one out of every four agricultural workers has left the sector for another job outside agriculture in the region. Between 2000 and 2020, the biggest drop was observed in Europe, as the agricultural population there has decreased by 50 percent from about 35 million, which represents a decrease of 18 million people. During the same period, even if the share of employment in agriculture declined in Africa (see Figure 11), agricultural employment increased to 224 million people. With around 200 million people working in each of China and India in agriculture, together they account for two- thirds of agricultural employment in Asia and 45 percent of global agricultural employment  even though 23 million people left the agriculture sector between 2000 and 2019 in India and 169 million in China (see Table 8). The share of employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing declined globally by about 13 percentage points between 2000 and 2020, to 27.4 percent (see Figure 11). Yet, agriculture remains the second largest source of employment worldwide after the services sector.6 A decline in the share of the agricultural sector is usually linked to growing income levels, which explains the drop in the share of employment in agriculture across all regions and nearly all the countries (see FIGURE 8.

SHARE OF AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING EMPLOYMENT IN TOTAL EMPLOYMENT BY REGIONTable 9). The COVID-19 pandemic broke this overall declining trend: while employment dropped in all sectors due to the COVID-19 restrictions, the industry and services sector were much more affected than agriculture, resulting in an increase of the share of agricultural employment in all regions except Europe between 2019 and 2020. The lowest share of employment in agriculture was observed in Europe in 2020, where only 5.2 percent of the employed population had a job in agriculture. The highest share was observed in Africa with 49.5 percent of the total employed population. FIGURE 10. EMPLOYMENT IN AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY AND FISHING BY REGIONFIGURE 9.

While on average women represented 36.7 percent of all agricultural workers in 2019, this share is above 50 percent in 23 countries (see Table 10), most of them in Africa. Women and men working in agriculture might have different employment status. Generally, the women employed in agriculture are more likely to be engaged as contributing family workers whereas men are more likely to be engaged on their own account as workers generating an income.7 In addition, women often spend more time than men on activities such as food processing and food preparation for the household, child and elder care, water and fuel collection and other unpaid household duties.8  Capital and investment Capital in the agriculture sector includes the machinery, equipment and tools as well as the farm buildings, and is essential in the production of all agricultural outputs. The Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is an indication of the amounts that are reinvested in new fixed assets that are part of capital. High-income countries tend to devote a higher share of their agriculture value added to reinvestments in the sector than countries with lower levels of income (see Figure 13 and Table 11). The three countries with the higher share of GFCF in value added in 2020 are all in Europe: Latvia (75 percent), Belgium (66 percent) and Estonia (61 percent). The leaders of the other regions all had shares of 2730 percent. Government spending on agriculture is a measure of the public financial support to the sector and complements investments made by the private sector. Asia and Africa had the highest percentage of central government spending to agriculture between 2000 and 2018.9 Figure 14 and Table 12 reflect this, as most of the countries with the highest shares are in these two regions, with Malawi (16.1 percent), Bhutan (10.9 percent), and Guyana (9.7 percent) as the top three countries. In the case of Africa, signatories to the Malabo Declaration of 2014 committed to allocate at least 10 percent of government expenditures to agriculture.10 INPUTS  Pesticides Global pesticides use increased during the period 20002019 by 36 percent, to 4.2 million tonnes in 2019 (see Figure 15). Nearly all the increase took place between 2000 and 2012, with a plateau afterwards. The highest contributions came from Asia, followed by the Americas, Europe, Africa and Oceania. The regional contributions to the world total changed slightly over time, but FIGURE 12.

The share of the Americas increased from 29 percent to 33 percent of global pesticides consumption while that of Europe decreased slightly from 14 percent to 11 percent. Africa and Oceania applied small amounts of pesticides over time, but Oceania nonetheless had the highest growth in pesticides applications (85 percent). As shown in Table 13, China was the largest pesticide user in 2019 with 1.8 million tonnes, or 42 percent of the world total, far ahead of the United States of America and Brazil (0.4 million tonnes each). Global pesticides use per cropland area went up 28 percent in the 2000s, from 2.1 kgha to 2.6 kgha, and levelled out after 2010 (see Figure 16), although with some important regional differences. Pesticides application rates in 2019 were highest in the Americas, followed by Asia, FIGURE 14.

In the 2010s, Oceania surpassed Europe, but both regions remained below the global average. Asia was the only region where pesticides use per cropland area did not increase between 2010 and 2019. The top three countries in terms of pesticides application rate for 2018 were Trinidad and Tobago, with 25 kgha, Saint Lucia, with 20 kgha and Ecuador, with 14 kgha (see Table 14).  Fertilizers Total agricultural use of inorganic fertilizers, expressed as the sum of the three nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (expressed as P2O5) and potassium (expressed as K2O), was 189 million tonnes in 2019. As shown in Figure 17, the breakdown was 108 million tonnes of nitrogen (57 percent of the total), 43 million tonnes of phosphorus (23 percent) and 37 million tonnes of potassium (20 percent). The overall fertilizer use in 2019 was 54 million tonnes, or 40 percent, higher than in 2000 (33 percent higher for nitrogen, 34 percent higher for phosphorus and 73 percent higher for potassium). CHAPTER 1 ECONOMIC DIMENSIONS OF AGRICULTURE9 Asia represented 56 percent of world total agricultural use of inorganic fertilizers in 2019, followed by the Americas (26 percent), Europe (12 percent), Africa (4 percent) and Oceania (2 percent). This ranking of the regions is the same for all nutrients. The main users of inorganic fertilizers are, in descending order, China, India, the United States of America and Brazil (see Table 15), with China the largest user of each nutrient. Fertilizer use increased in all regions between 2000 and 2019 (see Figure 18). The total for the three nutrients went up 33 million tonnes  the largest increase in absolute terms  in Asia, or 46 percent. The fastest increase took place in Africa, with a growth of 79 percent equivalent to just 3 million tonnes due to the low starting level. In the Americas, fertilizer use posted a 47 percent increase, or 16 million tonnes, while in Oceania it went up 14 percent (or 0.4 million tonnes) compared to 6 percent in Europe (or 1.4 million tonnes). The mix of nutrients varies across the regions. Nitrogen is the dominant nutrient, accounting for at least 60 percent of fertilizer use in Europe (64 percent), Africa (61 percent) and Asia (60 percent), and around half of the total in Oceania (51 percent) and the Americas (49 percent). The use of phosphorus accounts for 17 to 25 percent of the total in all the regions except Oceania, where its share is 36 percent. The share of potassium in fertilizer use is the highest in the Americas with 26 percent, followed by Europe (19 percent), Asia (18 percent), Africa (14 percent) and Oceania (13 percent). The use of phosphorus declined in Europe and Oceania between 2000 and 2019, while the use of potassium declined only in Europe over the same period. World agricultural use of inorganic fertilizers per cropland area rose by 34 percent during the 20002019 period, to 122 kg of nutrients per hectare  expressed as the sum of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (see Figure 19). This corresponds to an increase of 31 kgha compared with 2000. Of the total amount, 70 kgha correspond to nitrogen (up 28 percent), 28 kgha to phosphorus (up 28 percent) and 24 kgha to potassium (up 63 percent). Fertilizer use per cropland area in 2019 was the highest in Asia, at 180 kgha, followed by the Americas (135 kgha), Oceania (82 kgha), Europe (80 kgha) and Africa (26 kgha) as shown on Figure 19 and Table 16. With a growth rate of 49 percent between 2000 and 2019, Africa was the region with the fastest increase in fertilizer use per cropland area, ahead of the Americas (47 percent), Asia (37 percent) and Europe (12 percent)  Oceania is the only region showing a decrease (-8 percent).

WORLD PRODUCTION OF CROPS, MAIN COMMODITIESto a combination of factors seen in Chapter 1 (increased use of irrigation, pesticides and fertilizers, and to a lesser extent a larger cultivated area); other factors such as better farming practices11 and the use of high- yield crops12 also play a role. While a large number of crops are cultivated and harvested around the world, just four individual crops accounted for half the global production of primary crops in 2019: sugar cane (21 percent of the total, with 1.9 billion tonnes), maize (12 percent, with 1.1 billion tonnes), rice (8 percent, with 0.8 billion tonnes) and wheat (8 percent, with 0.8 billion tonnes)  see Figure 21. Oil palm fruit and potatoes each accounted for an additional 4 percent of world crop production. Sugar cane accounted for 21 percent of the global crop production over the 20002019 period. While maize, wheat and rice each represented 10 percent of the total in 2000, maize production grew three times faster than that of wheat or rice during the period, surpassing rice in 2001 to become the second most produced crop worldwide. 2000 2005 2010 2015 20190268 7 5 3 1910Billion tonnes4 Cereals Roots and tubers Sugar crops Oil crops Vegetables Fruit Other25 3424 1112 812 91199 32 2000 2005 2010 2015 2019 Sugar cane Oil palm fruit Maize Wheat Rice, paddy Potatoes Other02468 7 5 3 1910Billion tonnes 20211012 108 10543 84442 12 WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2021As seen in Table 18, the Americas is the leading region in the production of sugar cane (52 percent of the world total) and maize (49 percent), while Asia leads in the production of rice (90 percent), oil palm fruit (88 percent), wheat (44 percent) and potatoes (51 percent). Figure 22 shows that for each main crop commodity, the top three producers combined account for a significant share of the world total: slightly above 40 percent for wheat and potatoes, around 60 to 66 percent for sugar cane, maize and rice, and close to 90 percent for oil palm fruit in 2019. For each crop, the top producer also has a sizeable share of the global output: in 2019, Brazil accounted for around 40 percent of world sugar cane production, the United States of America grew around 30 percent of the global production for maize, China (which ranked in the top three producers for four out of the six main crop commodities) produced about 25 percent of the world output of rice and potatoes, and slightly less than 20 percent of the world output of wheat, while 60 percent of oil palm fruit production originated in Indonesia. Such a concentration can have a large impact on prices when harvests are affected  either positively or negatively  in the main producing countries that export part of their production. BOX 1. FOCUS ON THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES  PRODUCTION World fruit production went up 54 percent between 2000 and 2019, to 883 million tonnes, which represents an increase of 311 million tonnes. Five fruit species accounted for 57 percent of the total production in 2019, down from 63 percent in 2000: bananas and plantains (18 percent), watermelons (11 percent), apples (10 percent), oranges and grapes (9 percent each). The share of bananas and plantains in the global total slightly increased since 2000, while that of the other main fruit species declined. FIGURE B1.

Therefore, they have an impact on nutrition and health, but also on energy and the environment. The total world production of vegetable oils more than doubled between 2000 and 2018, to 201 million tonnes in 2018 (see Figure 23 and Table 19). This is 109 million tonnes more than in 2000. Palm oil had the largest increase, both absolute and relative, as its production went up 49 million tonnes, or 222 percent; it overtook soybean oil as the main vegetable oil produced in 2006. The use of palm oil for biodiesel explains most of this spectacular growth.13 The other main vegetable oils are rapeseed oil, accounting for 12 percent of global vegetable oil production Source: FAOSTAT https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig24FIGURE 24.

The concentration is highest with palm oil, as close to 85 percent of global production came from two countries in 2018: Indonesia (57 percent) and Malaysia (27 percent). This mirrors the shares of the top producers of 14 WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2021Source: FAOSTAT Note: Percentages on the figure indicate the shares in the total; they may not tally due to rounding. https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig25FIGURE 25.

In 2018, the top three producers accounted for 6065 percent of the production of soybean oil and sunflower oil, and for 44 percent of the production of rapeseed oil. China was the main producer of soybean oil, with a share of 29 percent in 2018 and the United States of America a distant second with a share of 19 percent. The difference between the first and second producer was much smaller for rapeseed and sunflower oil: Canada led the production of rapeseed oil in 2018, with 17 percent of the world total, just ahead of China (15 percent), while Ukraine produced 28 percent of the global sunflower oil production in 2018, with the Russian Federation a close second (25 percent). The global production of raw sugar reached 182 million tonnes in 2017, up 37 percent compared with 2000, or 49 million tonnes (see Figure 25 and Table 20). As sugar cane, the main sugar crop, grows in tropical regions, the main producing countries are located there. The largest producing country is Brazil, which increased its share in the world total from 13 percent in 2000 to 22 percent in 2017. It overtook India in 2003, which accounted for 12 percent of the global production in 2017. The other main producers account for 4 to 6 percent of the total production each, with the Russian Federation relying only on sugar beet for sugar production.PRODUCTION OF LIVESTOCK AND LIVESTOCK COMMODITIES World meat production reached 337 million tonnes in 2019, up 44 percent, or 103 million tonnes compared with 2000 (see Figure 26). Although many species are raised for their meat, only three accounted for nearly 90 percent of the global production during the 20002018 period: chicken, pig and cattle (not taking into account the different breeds for each). With 35 percent of the global production in 2019, chicken meat showed the largest growth in absolute and relative terms since 2000 (101 percent, or 59 million tonnes) and was the most produced type of meat in 2019. The market concentration of meat production is not as strong as for primary crops and vegetable oils, even though the top three producers accounted for 56 percent of world pig meat production and slightly more than 40 percent of global chicken and cattle meat production (see Figure 27 and Table 21). China and the United States of America are among the three largest producers for each main meat type: in particular, China alone accounts for about 40 percent of world pig meat, and the United States of America produced 17 to 18 percent of world chicken and cattle meat. The difference between the two countries is that meat production in China is mostly for the domestic market, whereas a significant share of American meat production (especially in the case of chicken) is exported.14 World milk production rose by 52 percent to 883 million tonnes in 2019, an increase of 304 million tonnes compared with 2000 (see Figure 28).

In particular, milk production in Asia more than doubled between 2000 and 2019, from 170 million tonnes to 369 million tonnes mostly due to the increase in India (108 million tonnes), which is the largest producer with a 21 percent share of the global total in 2019. With a 11 percent share, the United States of America was the second largest producer; the other main producers (Pakistan, China, Brazil, Germany, the Russian Federation and France) each accounted for 3 to 6 percent of the global production. The combined share of the top three milk producers was 39 percent of the total, the same as in 2018 (see Table 22). In 2019, world hen eggs production reached 83 million tonnes, a 63 percent increase from the 2000 level, which translates into an additional 32 million tonnes over the period (see Figure 29). Asia is by far the main producing region, accounting for 62 percent of the global production in 2019, followed by the Americas (21 percent), Europe (13 percent), Africa (4 percent) and Oceania (0.4 percent). Production growth rates were well above 60 percent in all the regions but Europe, where it grew by just 14 percent (see Table 23); as a result, its share in the world total drops from 18 percent to 13 percent. With 35 percent of the total, China ranked as the largest hen egg producing country; the other main producers (the United States of America, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, Japan and the Russian Federation) combined do not surpass it. Together, the top three producers accounted for nearly half the global hen eggs production in 2019. CHAPTER 2 PRODUCTION, TRADE AND PRICES OF COMMODITIES17 FIGURE 31.

This represents an overall expansion of 52 million tonnes compared to 2000. The slight decline in production between 2018 and 2019 is due to a 5 percent decrease (or 3.8 million tonnes) in the production of marine fish (3.8 million tonnes), caused by the decrease of catches of anchoveta (-39.7 percent or 2.8 million tonnes compared to 2018) mainly related to the El Niño phenomenon and of other pelagic species. The total first sale value of the 2019 production is estimated at USD 406 billion.15 A large number of species are harvested every year, with the quantities and specific species varying from country to country. Finfish (freshwater, diadromous and marine fish) had a share of 76 percent of the total in 2019, with a slight decline compared to 79 percent in 2000. With 39 percent of the total, marine fish were the main group of species produced in 2019, followed by freshwater fish (33 percent), molluscs (13 percent) and crustaceans (9 percent) (see Table 24). Thanks to the expansion of aquaculture production, freshwater fish experienced major growth, more than doubling (137 percent) between 2000 and 2019, going from about 25 million tonnes in 2000 (19 percent of the total) to 58 million tonnes in 2019. Other major increases were experienced by crustaceans (112 percent) and diadromous fish (103 percent). The significant expansion of the fisheries and aquaculture production came with many transformations, including changes in the source of production being increasingly dependent on aquaculture. In the last three decades, aquaculture has been the main driver of the increase in fisheries and aquaculture production, with an average growth of 5.2 percent per year in the period 20002019, reaching a record 85.3 million tonnes in 2019. At the global level, after several decades of sustained growth, capture fisheries production has been rather stable at around 90 million tonnes since the early 1990s, with some inter- annual fluctuations in the range of 3 to 6 million tonnes. These fluctuations have been mainly determined by variations in catches of anchoveta in South America, particularly affected by climatic change variability, but they also depended on the productivity of ecosystems, fishing intensity management and fish stock 18 WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2021status. In 2019, capture fisheries production reached 92.5 million tonnes, down from its 2018 peak of 96.4 million tonnes, representing 52 percent of total production. As seen in Table 25, Asia played a major role in the overall growth of fisheries and aquaculture production and represented about 70 percent of total production in 2019 compared to 57 percent in 2000. In 2019, the Americas had a share of 12 percent, followed by Europe (10 percent), Africa (7 percent) and Oceania (1 percent). China is by far the main producer for both capture fisheries and aquaculture, with a 36 percent share of the total production in 2019, compared with 30 percent in 2000. In 2019, other major producers were Indonesia and India, and these three countries together represented slightly more than 50 percent of total fisheries and aquaculture production. These three countries were also the dominant producers for capture fisheries and aquaculture. The overall share of the top three producers was 73 percent of aquaculture and 30 percent of capture fisheries in 2019. Despite this concentration of production, aquaculture has experienced growth across the world, with the unequal rates reflecting differences in local policy, management objectives, site opportunities and environmental factors. In addition, 35.8 million tonnes of seaweed and other aquatic plants were produced in 2019, the bulk of which (97 percent) originating from culture-based practices. If aquatic plants are also included, since 2013 aquaculture became the main source of fishery and aquaculture production, with a share of 56 percent of the total in 2019.16PRODUCTION OF THE FORESTRY SECTOR Global production of roundwood rose from 3.5 billion m3 in 2000 to around 4 billion m3 in 2019, which represents a 14 percent increase over the period (see Figure 33). In 2019, wood fuel was the main product with a 49 percent share of the total (1.9 billion m3), followed by coniferous industrial roundwood with 29 percent (1.2 billion m3) and non-coniferous industrial roundwood with 22 percent (0.9 billion m3). In particular, the rebound was quite strong after the decline in coniferous industrial roundwood production in 2009, which resulted in the lowest total roundwood production during the 20002018 period. As seen in Table 26, Asia and the Americas are the two main producing regions, accounting each for 2829 percent of the total roundwood production; Africa and Europe have similar shares of 2021 percent, while Oceania represents the remaining 2 percent. The share of the combined three main producers of roundwood commodities in 2019 was roughly 30 percent for wood fuel, 40 percent for non-coniferous industrial roundwood and 50 percent for coniferous industrial roundwood (see Figure 34). As many developing countries rely on wood for energy purposes (notably cooking), the larger producers are all in this category: in 2019, India ranked first with 302 million m3 (16 percent of total production), followed by China with 160 million m3 and Brazil with 123 million m3 (respectively 8 percent and 6 percent of global production). Table 26 shows that five African countries are included in the top 10: Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Ghana and Uganda. The main industrial roundwood producers are all countries with a large forest area and an established logging industry. In FIGURE 32.

The production of paper and paperboard declined for the second consecutive year, reaching 405 million tonnes  a decrease of 0.8 percent over the 2018 production. The same is true for recovered paper, with a production of 231 million tonnes in 2019 (-0.5 percent over the 2018 production). Over the 20002019 period though, the two products show a production increase of 25 percent (paper and paperboard) and 61 percent (recovered paper). Wood pulp production dropped by 1 percent to 190 million tonnes in 2019 compared to its 2018 peak, but is still up 11 percent compared to the 2000 amounts. The production of wood charcoal reached its highest value in 2019 with 54 million tonnes, up 46 percent from the 2000 level. Wood pellets and other agglomerates, for which data collection was started in 2012, show a steady growth with a production record of 47 million tonnes in 2019, an increase of 102 percent since the 23 million tonnes produced in 2012. World production of sawnwood recovered strongly from its low point of 2009 and dipped slightly in 2019 from its 2018 record, to 489 million m3, an increase of 27 percent compared with 2000. The production of wood-based panels has steadily increased since 2009, with the 373 million m3 produced in 2019 representing a 109 percent increase from the 2000 production. TRADE The monetary value of global food exports multiplied by 3.6 in nominal terms between 2000 and 2019, from about USD 380 billion in 2000 to slightly less than USD 1.4 trillion in 2019, with strong increases in all food commodity groups (see Figure 36). Fruit and vegetables accounted for 20 percent of the total value of food exports in 2019, followed by cereals and preparations (14 percent). Fish and meat each had a share of 11 percent. As seen in Table 28, the United States of America was the largest food exporter in 2019 with 9 percent of the total, followed by the Netherlands and China (6 percent each). Looking at the food net trade, defined as the nominal value of exports minus that of imports, two regions stand out: the Americas as the largest net exporter with a USD 105 billion surplus in CHAPTER 2 PRODUCTION, TRADE AND PRICES OF COMMODITIES21 FIGURE 38.

The largest net importing countries are China (-USD 90 billion), Japan (-USD 54 billion) and the United States of America (-USD 31 billion). Table 30 shows that meat accounts for the larger share of Chinas food imports, while fish is Japans main food import and fruit and vegetables the United States of Americas. Trade flows vary considerably between regions and commodity groups (see Figure 38). The largest individual flows are observed for fruit and vegetables, with Europe importing USD 129 billion and exporting USD 95 billion in 2019. Asia was the top importing region for cereals and preparations, fats and oils, meat and meat preparations, and sugar and honey; for beverages, dairy and eggs, fish and fruit and vegetables, the main importer was Europe. For all commodity groups but two, Europe was the main exporter; Asia led for fats and oils and fish. Meat and meat preparations are the commodity group with the largest net trade amounts: Asias trade deficit was USD 47 billion, while the Americas surplus was USD 30 billion. In 2019, Asia was a net importer of all commodity groups but fish, and Africa was a net importer of all commodity groups but fish, and fruit and vegetables. Oceania was a net exporter of all commodity groups in 2019. The Americas and Europe were net exporters of most groups, but each had significant net imports in one category: the Americas had a deficit of USD 18 billion for beverages and Europe had one of USD 34 billion for fruit and vegetables. Looking at the quantities instead of the values traded gives a vastly different picture. In that case, cereals are by a wide margin the most traded commodity group, with exports reaching 468 million tonnes in 2019 (see Figure 39 and Table 31). This is 194 million tonnes, or 71 percent more than in 2000, but 12 million tonnes lower than the 2018 record exports  a decline mostly due to lower wheat exports. Three crops accounted for 87 percent of all exports in 2019: maize (39 percent), wheat (38 percent) and rice (9 percent). Maize became in 2019 the most exported cereal by weight, a result of steadily increasing maize exports over the past decade and a decrease of wheat exports since 2017. For each of the main traded cereals, exports tend to originate from a few countries while imports are more dispersed (see Figure 40).17 In 2019, the top three exporters accounted for significant shares of the total exports: CHAPTER 2 PRODUCTION, TRADE AND PRICES OF COMMODITIES23 Source: FAO https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig44FIGURE 44.

In comparison, the top three importers accounted for 15 to 25 percent of the total imports for these commodities. The main producers tend to also feature among the main exporters. China stands out as a major producing country focusing on domestic demand since its exports are fairly small compared to its production Tables 20 and 32); it is also the second largest importer of rice. The nominal value of global forest products exports amounted to USD 244 billion in 2019, up USD 100 billion or 69 percent compared with 2000, but down USD 28 billion, or 10 percent from the record high USD 273 billion of 2018 (see Figure 41and Table 33). All the main products rebounded after their sharp drop in 2009. With 40 percent of the total value, paper and paperboard was the most traded commodity in 2019, even though its share steadily declined from 48 percent in 2000. Together with pulp for paper and recovered paper, it accounts for 58 percent of the total. Pulp for paper, sawnwood and wood-based panels each represented 13 to 15 percent of the value of forestry exports in 2019, with small changes compared to their 2000 shares. PRICES The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Food Price Index, which measures the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, consists of the average of five commodity group price indices (cereals, dairy, meat, oils and sugar), weighted with the average export shares of each of the groups for 20142016. Since January 2000, it went up 74.8 points to 127.4 points in August 2021 (see Figure 42 and Table 34). The FAO Food Price Index surged in 20072008 during the food security crisis that saw the price of cereals reach record levels, especially rice and wheat. Food prices soared again in late 2010 and early 2011 (especially sugar and dairy). Overall, the period of sustained high prices lasted much longer than in the previous commodity price booms and busts with the return to the pre-surge 24 WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2021price levels only five years later, in January 2016. The FAO Food Price Index declined during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting uncertainties faced by commodity markets. However, it increased for 12 months in a row between May 2020 and May 2021 to its highest value since 2011, as COVID-19 restrictions affected supply chains and pushed prices up. An important factor to note is that the overall trend of the FAO Food Price Index can mask a wide discrepancy of movements across sectors, as shown in Figure 43. The market fundamentals of supply and demand, as well as exchange rates dynamics, drive the evolution of international prices. The indices for vegetable oils and sugar show great volatility since the beginning of 2018, with a sharp drop during the first months of 2020 (as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted international food markets) followed by a doubling over the following 16 months. Even though the indices for all commodity groups increased in 2021 to their highest levels since 2018, the indices for cereals, dairy and meat appear less volatile. The FAO Fish Price Index measures the monthly changes in international prices of a basket of fisheries and aquaculture commodities. The index consists of the average of five commodity group price indices (whitefish, salmon, tuna, other pelagic fish and shrimps) weighted by the average export shares of each of the groups for the 20142016 period. Since January 2000, it went up from 65.5 to 100.3 points in August 2021. It showed several fluctuations during the overall period with higher prices experienced in 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, from 2016 to early 2019 and in early 2021 (see Figure 44).

Being an average, it masks wide differences among species and across the aquaculture and capture fisheries sector, in addition to the dynamics of supply and demand and exchange rates. For example, tunas, which rely almost entirely on capture fisheries, showed more price fluctuations than shrimps, which are increasingly sourced from aquaculture. In the first half of 2021, the price indices of all commodity groups were up compared with the same period in 2020, except for tunas. Looking at the country level, changes in domestic prices received by agricultural producers varied between -34 percent (in Zimbabwe) and 53 percent (in the Maldives) in 2019 compared with 2018 (see Figure 45 and Table 35). CHAPTER 2 PRODUCTION, TRADE AND PRICES OF COMMODITIES25 The largest fluctuations, either up or down, often took place in Asia and Africa. Many factors can affect producer prices, including favourable or poor harvests compared to the previous year, production costs, market structure, subsidy schemes and external factors  as is the case, for instance, of economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2018. The characteristics of the food supply chain (including the transformation of goods and the incorporation of services along the chain) play a key role in shaping the transmission of price shocks between producers and consumers. They can explain different rates of change in producer prices compared to consumer prices.Consumer prices for food increased unevenly across regions between 2015 and 2021 (see Figure 46 and Table 36). While the world average fluctuated between 1.4 percent and 3.3 percent between January 2015 and the beginning of 2019, it then increased steadily to peak at 7 percent in April 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic started to affect the world economy. It has since slowly decreased but remained at or above 5 percent. Africa experienced the highest inflation rate in food prices for most of the period, reaching a peak at 18.4 percent in April 2017. Inflation in food prices accelerated markedly starting in the second half of 2020, from 8.2 percent in September 2020 to 13.4 percent in June 2021. For most of the period, Asia had the second highest inflation rate in food prices, which almost doubled from 5.7 percent in September 2020 to 10.4 percent in February 2020 before decreasing to around 6 percent in 2021. Inflation rates in food prices, which had been negative for several months in a row in the Americas in 20162017 and Oceania in 20162018, have steadily increased to their highest value in 2020: 8.4 percent in June 2020 for the Americas (followed by a plateau for most of 2021), and 11.2 percent in December 2020 for Oceania (followed by a drop to around 9 percent). In contrast, the increase in consumer prices for food has remained around 2 percent in 20172019 in Europe, with a brief increase to 3.4 percent in April 2020 followed by a decrease to 0.7 percent in June 2021. KEY FACTSCHAPTER 3 DIETARY ENERGY SUPPLY770 MILLION PEOPLEPREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT PREVALENCE OF FOOD INSECURITY INCREASE OF OBESITYIn every continent, the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity is slightly higher for women than for men, with the largest differences found in Latin America and the Caribbean. Dietary energy supply went up in all regions since 2000, with the fastest increases in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean.Obesity has increased in all regions. Almost 30 of adults in Northern America, Europe and Oceania are obese.While most of the undernourished people live in Asia, Africa has the highest prevalence of undernourishment.160 MILLION PEOPLEMOST OF THE UNDERNOURISHED PEOPLE ASIA, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN OTHER REGIONS OF ADULTS ARE OBESE 2000RISE OF HUNGER Hunger is on the rise, with almost 770 million people undernourished in 2020, close to 160 million more than in 2014, and 118 million more than in 2019.ASIA AFRICAHIGHEST PREVALENCE OF UNDERNOURISHMENT 30 NORTHERN AMERICA EUROPE OCEANIA20142020 27 3FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION FOOD SECURITY After a decades-long decline and five years of stability since 2014, the global level of the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) has increased sharply between 2019 and 2020, mostly due to the COVID- 19 pandemic (see Figure 47 and Table 37). Nearly 10 percent of the world population suffered from hunger in 2020, compared with 8.4 percent in 2019. The situation is most alarming in Africa, where the PoU is the highest among all regions and has increased the most between 2019 and 2020  by 3 percentage points. In 2020, 21 percent of the population in Africa were undernourished. The PoU in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was also increasing since 2014, jumped from 7.1 percent in 2019 to 9.1 percent in 2020. In Asia, the PoU has been mostly declining since 2002 and remained the second highest among all regions until 2019; the increase between 2019 and 2020 was just 1.1 percentage points, from 7.9 percent to 9 percent. The PoU in Oceania has stayed stable since 2014 at around 6.2 percent.Almost 770 million people in the world were still hungry in 2020 (see Figure 48). While this level is 4 percent less than in 2000, it is 18 percent more than in 2019, equivalent to 118 million additional people going hungry in one year. Even though its PoU is the third highest, Asia is home to 54 percent of the worlds hungry people due to its large population base, and the two countries with the largest number of hungry people are in Asia (see Table 38). Even though the number of hungry people in Asia declined Source: FAOSTAT Note: The prevalence of undernourishment for Northern America and Europe is estimated to be less than 2.5 percent.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, 60 million people were undernourished in 2020, an increase of 30 percent, or 14 million people, from 2019, and a 6 percent increase from 2000. By contrast, the hungry population in Africa increased by 46 million, or 20 percent, from 2019, reaching 282 million in 2020, which is a 40 percent increase from the 2000 value. Hunger in Oceania increased by 23 percent, or 0.5 million people, during the 20002020 period, of which 0.1 million were added between 2019 and 2020. In 2020, 11.9 percent of the world population (928 million people) were exposed to severe food insecurity based on the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) (see Figure 49). The levels and trends over the 20142020 period are broadly consistent with those of the PoU, confirming that these two indicators complement each other as they both measure the extent of severe food deprivation. As one of the official Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators, the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity provides additional information on people who do not have regular access to nutritious and sufficient food, even if they are not necessarily suffering from hunger. In 2020, it is estimated that an additional 18.5 percent of the world population, or 1.4 billion people, have experienced food insecurity at moderate levels. This brings the total estimates for moderate or severe food insecurity in 2020 to 30.4 percent of the world population, or 2.4 billion people. Similar to the PoU, food insecurity experienced a steep increase between 2019 and 2020 equal to that of the previous five years combined. Nearly one in three people in the world (2.37 billion) did not have access to nutritious and sufficient food in 2020  an increase of almost 320 million people in just one year. As seen in Table 39, moderate or severe food insecurity is much higher in Africa than in any other part of the world, affecting close to 60 percent of the population in 2020. This is followed by Latin America (41 percent), Asia (26 percent), Oceania (12 percent) and Northern America and Europe (9 percent). FOOD SUPPLY The world average dietary energy supply (DES), measured as calories per capita per day, has been increasing steadily to 2 950 kcal per person per day over the period from 2018 to 2020, up 9 percent compared with 2000 to 2002 (see Figure 50 and Table 40). It is the highest in Northern America and Europe at about 3 520 kcal per person per day; the gap with Oceania and Latin America and the Caribbean, slightly above 3 000 kcal per person per day, is substantial. The fastest increase took place in Asia BOX 2. FOCUS ON THE STATE OF FOOD SECURITY AND NUTRITION IN THE WORLD (SOFI) 2021 The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) data collected by FAO in more than 140 countries over six years at the individual (rather than household) level provide a unique opportunity to produce gender-disaggregated estimates for the prevalence of food insecurity.

While the lowest among all regions, Africa has also witnessed a steady increase in DES followed by a slight decline in recent years, probably due to the drought in 2016 and political conflicts in some countries that adversely affected agricultural production.19 Given the importance of cereals as staple foods worldwide (see Figure 52) and the discrepancy between consumption and production in many countries, a measure of food security is the cereals imports dependency ratio, defined as the net trade of cereals (imports minus exports) divided by the total cereals supply in a country (the countrys own production plus the imports minus the exports). Among the most cereals import-dependent countries in the period from 2016 to 2018, the majority are small island developing states20 and countries in the Near East, where the natural conditions are not favourable to cereals production (see Figure 51 and Table 41). The composition of the dietary energy supply, detailed in food balance sheets,21 varies greatly between the regions, with notable evolutions between 2000 and 2018 (see Figure 52 and Table 42). Cereals were the most important contributor to the dietary energy supply in all regions, with shares in 2018 ranging from 24 percent in Oceania to 50 percent in Asia and Africa. Fats and oils is the second major food group in all the regions but Africa. Regional specificities include the high share of roots, tubers and pulses in Africa, of sugar in the Americas and Oceania, and of fats and oils in Oceania. Between 2000 and 2018, the most visible changes in the composition of the food supply took place in Asia (where the share of cereals dropped by 7 percentage points while that of fats and oils, meat, fruit and vegetables, and dairy and eggs increased significantly).The average protein supply increased in all regions between 2000 and 2018 (see Figure 53 and Table 43). The growth in developing regions was faster than the world average of 10 percent: 15 percent in Asia, 13 percent in Africa and 12 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The share of protein from animal origin went up across all regions as well (as a consequence of the increased share of meat, fish, and dairy and eggs in diets observed in Figure 52): it is highest in Oceania and lowest in Africa. Strong disparities also prevail between regions in terms of levels and composition. Protein supply was highest in Northern America and Europe in 20162018, with 105 g per person per day compared with 61 g per person per day for Africa  the primary reason for this is the difference in the availability of protein from animal-sourced foods. In 20162018, plants were the main source of protein in BOX 3. FOCUS ON THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES  DIETARY ASPECTS The share of fruit and vegetables in the global dietary energy supply went from 5.6 percent in 2000 to 6.8 percent in 2018, with an even split between fruit and vegetables. Asia is the main driver behind this increase, as its share jumped from 5.6 percent in 2000 to 7.5 percent  the highest among all regions  in 2018. Africa and Europe also had increases, but much smaller. Oceania saw a significant decrease of 1 percentage point (due to a lower fruit consumption), while the decline in the Americas was marginal. The breakdown is roughly the same in Africa and the Americas, with the largest share of fruit in the total (around 4 percent) and the lowest share of vegetables (less than 2 percent), even though the absolute quantities consumed are higher in the Americas. Asia also stands out as the only region where the share of vegetables in dietary energy supply is greater than that of fruit.FIGURE B3.

In recent years, the average dietary supply adequacy in Africa remained unchanged or decreased because of the declining dietary energy supply in the region (see Figure 50). Dietary supply adequacy divides a countrys average supply of calories for food consumption by the average dietary energy requirement estimated for its population, to measure the adequacy of food supply in terms of calories. Analysed together with the prevalence of undernourishment, it helps identify the cause of undernourishment as mainly due to insufficient food supply or to particularly bad distribution. NUTRITION The prevalence of stunting among children under five years (as well as the number of stunted children) decreased worldwide from 33 percent in 2000 to 22 percent in 2020 (see Figure 55).

However, this global progress may have disguised a starker situation in some parts of the world. As seen in Table 45, the prevalence of child stunting is still extremely high in some countries, sometimes reaching more than 50 percent. A majority of the countries with a high prevalence of stunting are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Obesity among adults of 18 years and above increased rapidly in every region of the world between 2000 and 2016 (see Figure 56). In 2016, 13.1 percent of the adult population in the world was obese, an increase from 8.7 percent in 2000. Oceania and Northern America and Europe had the highest prevalence of adult obesity (both at around 2728 percent), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. The prevalence of adult obesity in Africa and Asia was lower than the world average, although it has been steadily increasing.The 20 countries with the highest prevalence of obesity among adults in 2016 were clustered in the Pacific Islands, the Near East and North Africa (see Figure 57). In all of them, 30 percent or more of the population is obese, with the highest proportion in Nauru at 61 percent. For many of these countries, multiple forms of malnutrition coexist: in Egypt, for example, the prevalence of child stunting was as high as 22.3 percent in 2014 (see Table 45), while the prevalence of adult obesity was 32 percent in 2016 (see Table 46).

Within regions, Europe has the largest share of forest land (46 percent), closely followed by the Americas (41 percent), while the other regions are all around 20 percent. More than half of all land (54 percent) in Asia is agricultural land, compared with 45 percent in Oceania, 37 percent in Africa, 29 percent Source: FAOSTAT https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig58FIGURE 58. SHARE OF LAND AREA BY TYPE AND REGIONin the Americas and 21 percent in Europe. The conversion of land from one use to another also varied between the regions. Oceania had agricultural land converted to other land. Both Africa and the Americas converted forest land to agricultural land andor other land. Europe and Asia were the only regions to have forest land expansion coupled with agricultural land reduction from 2000 to 2019. Countries with the highest share of forest area in land area are located in all regions of the world, mostly the tropical ones; they also tend to be developing countries (see Figure 59). Forest covered 97 percent of the land area in Suriname, 94 percent in Guyana and 92 percent in the Federated States of Micronesia. The biggest increases in the share of forest area between 2000 and 2019 took place in Viet Nam (9 percentage points), Cuba (9 percentage points) and Fiji (7 percentage points), while the largest decreases in the share of forest area over the same period happened in Paraguay (-17 percentage points), Nicaragua (-16 percentage points) and Cambodia (-14 percentage 2000 2019 2000 2019 2000 2019 2000 2019 2000 2019 2000 2019 Africa Americas Asia Europe Oceania World Forest land Agricultural land Other land0102030405060708090100Percentage 36 WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2021points), as featured in Table 48. In absolute terms, the top country for afforestation was China, with an additional 41 million ha of forest between 2000 and 2019; deforestation was the strongest in Brazil as 53 million ha of forest were lost there in the 20002019 period (see Table 47). FARMING The global harvested area of primary crops went up 21 percent between 2000 and 2019 to 1.4 billion ha (see Figure 60). Cereals accounted for more than half the worlds harvested area during the period, even though their share declined to 51 percent in 2019 (see Table 49). Oil crops covered 23 percent of the global harvested area and experienced the fastest growth in both absolute (102 million ha) and relative terms (46 percent). The other main crop groups each account for less than 5 percent of the global harvested area. The overall harvested area did not change between 2018 and 2019, as declines in the harvested areas of cereals and other crops were offset by increases in the other groups of crops, with oil crops registering the largest absolute gain. One visible aspect of the efforts to make the agriculture sector more sustainable is the rise of organic agriculture, the main feature of which is its avoidance of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.22 In 2019, the agriculture area under certified organic status or in conversion to organic was 72.2 million ha. Australia accounted for half the total, followed by Argentina (5 percent) and Spain (3 percent). The eight countries with the largest organic agriculture area made up 73 percent of the global area under certified organic agriculture (see Figure 61 and Table 50).Normalizing the agriculture area under certified organic or in conversion to organic by the country area allows for comparison of the importance that countries give to this aspect of sustainable agriculture. Looking at countries with a sizeable agricultural area in Figure 62, the countries with the highest share of area under organic agriculture in total agricultural area for 2019 are Austria (25 percent), Sweden (20 percent) and Czechia (15 percent). Fifteen of the top 20 countries are in Europe, highlighting that the region has emphasized the importance of organic agriculture. In other regions, the balance between conventional versus organic farming is still tilted towards the conventional (see Table 51). WATER Water stress, defined as the share of freshwater withdrawal in available freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental water requirements, affects predominantly Western and Central Asia as well as Northern Africa (see Figure 63 and Table 52). The countries experiencing the most acute water stress levels in 2018 (Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia) are all located in the Arabian peninsula and are withdrawing each year 10 to almost 40 times their renewable freshwater resources available. As a result, non-renewable water resources are used and are diminishing rapidly. The national water stress level can hide some differences within a country. Water stress disaggregation by river basins shows that the basins affected by severe water stress are located not only in Northern Africa and the Near East but also in Northern America, Central and Southern Asia and on the west coast of Latin America.23 Source: FAOSTAT https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig59FIGURE 59.

An excess of nutrients can lead to environmental risks (for example via additional outputs, such as volatilization, leaching and runoff), while insufficient levels of nutrients constrain yields. Figure 64 and Table 53 show that the global average soil nitrogen budget went up 19 percent to 65 kgha between 2000 and 2018, although it remained stable during the 2010s. With 96 kgha in 2018, Asia had the highest soil nitrogen budget, followed by the Americas (71 kgha), Europe (48 kgha), Oceania (41 kgha) and Source: FAOSTAT Note: Only countries with more than 2 million ha of agricultural area are taken into account. https:doi.org10.4060cb4477en-fig62FIGURE 62.

Total emissions on agricultural land in 2019 amounted to 10.7 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2eq) of GHG released into the atmosphere in 2019, a decrease of 2 percent, or 0.2 Gt CO2eq compared with 2000 ( Figure 65 and Table 54). Activities within the farm gate accounted for 7.2 Gt CO2eq, or 67 percent of the total emissions in 2019, followed by net forest conversion deforestation (2.9 Gt CO2eq, or 27 percent) and fires in humid tropical forests and organic soils (0.6 Gt CO2eq, or 5 percent). Asia was the top agricultural emitter, with 4.1 Gt CO2eq (38 percent of the total) in 2019, followed by the Americas (3.1 Gt CO2eq, or 29 percent), Africa (2.4 Gt CO2eq, or 22 percent), Europe (0.9 Gt CO2eq, or 9 percent) and Oceania (0.2 Gt CO2eq, or 2 percent). CO2 represents 42 percent of the total emissions, or 4.5 Gt CO2eq. Next are methane (CH4) with 4.1 Gt CO2eq (38 percent) and nitrous oxide (N2O) with 2.1 Gt CO2eq (20 percent). World agriculture emissions within the farm gate (those related to crops and livestock) grew by 11 percent between 2000 and 2019, to 7.2 Gt CO2eq (see Figure 66 and Table 55). Around 55 percent derive from livestock-related activities, and with 2.8 Gt CO2eq, the emissions from enteric fermentation generated in the digestive system of ruminant livestock were alone responsible for about 40 percent of agricultural emissions. Animal and synthetic sources of soil fertilization contributed to more than one-fifth of agricultural emissions. Drained organic soils were responsible for a constant 11 to 12 percent share of farm-gate emissions over the 20002019 period, while methane released from the cultivation of rice paddies accounted for 9 to 10 percent. Calculating emissions intensitiesc allows for comparison of the GHG performance of a range of commodities, as they represent an indication of the efficiency of production for each commodity, by country and over time.

The intensity of pig and chicken meat is much lower (1.5 kg CO2eqkg and 0.6 kg CO2eqkg respectively), in the same range as processed livestock commodities such as cow milk (0.9 kg CO2eqkg) and hen eggs (0.6 kg CO2eqkg) or rice (0.9 kg CO2eqkg). With 0.2 kg CO2eq kg, cereals excluding rice have the lowest emissions intensity of all major commodities. As seen in Table 56, the intensities change significantly across regions, reflecting large differences in associated efficiencies of production. For instance, the emissions intensity of cattle meat is almost twice the world average in Africa (48 kg CO2eqkg) and nearly half in Europe (14 kg CO2eqkg). FIGURE 66.

The average temperature change in the 2010s was 1.26 C, compared to 0.96 C in the 2000s. As seen in Table 57, more than 150 countries had a mean annual temperature change at least 1.0 C higher than the 19511980 average in 2020; the largest mean annual temperature change was recorded in the Russian Federation (3.7 C). ANNEXES 43 ANNEX 1: FAO WORK ON STATISTICS Statistics are at the core of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), its mandate and strategic goals. Article I of its constitution states that The Organization shall collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture.  the term agriculture and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture. FAO has a decentralized statistical system, with several technical units carrying out statistical activities. The Statistics Division (ESS) produces a vast array of data on agriculture (covering the socioeconomic, environmental, production, trade, food security and nutrition aspects), which form the majority of FAO statistics  other technical divisions are in charge of data on fisheries and aquaculture, forestry, international commodity prices and water. ESS develops and advocates for the implementation of methodologies and standards for data collection, validation, processing and analysis of food and agriculture statistics. In these statistical domains, it also plays a vital role in the compilation, processing and dissemination of internationally comparable data, and provides essential capacity-building support to member countries. In addition, ESS disseminates documents, working papers and statistical publications that cover agricultural and food security statistics (including prices, production, trade and agri-environmental statistical data). ESS is involved in managing a number of large- scale projects aimed at improving statistical methodologies and establishing best practices for collecting, collating, processing, and for disseminating and using data relevant to food security, agriculture and rural areas. The Office of Chief Statistician (OCS) is responsible for the overall coordination and governance of FAOs statistical work, both at headquarters and in FAOs Regional and Country Offices. OCS provides guidance to the technical units in charge of data acquisition, compilation and dissemination, with the aim of ensuring quality and consistency of statistical practices at the corporate level. It plays a quality assurance role in developing methods and standards for food and agriculture statistics and in providing technical assistance and capacity development to member countries. OCS also leads the Organizations work to monitor the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators under FAO custodianship. 44 ANNEX 2: DEFINITIONS AND NOTES ADULT OBESITY, PREVALENCE The prevalence of obesity in the adult population is the percentage of adults age 18 and over whose Body Mass Index (BMI) is more than 30 kgm².

Source: FAO, Statistics Division Owner: FAO AQUACULTURE FISH PRODUCTION Aquaculture fish production is defined as the farming of aquatic organisms. Farming implies some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding, protection from predators, etc. Farming also implies individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated. For statistical purposes, aquatic organisms, which are harvested by an individual or corporate body that has owned them throughout their rearing period, contribute to aquaculture, while aquatic organisms, which are exploitable by the public as a common property resource, with or without appropriate licences, are the harvest of fisheries. In the case of capture-based aquaculture, only the incremental growth (or weight gain) in captivity, could and should be reported as the production from aquaculture. Data included here cover aquaculture production of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and miscellaneous aquatic animals but exclude the production of marine mammals, crocodiles, corals, pearls, sponges and aquatic plants. Fish production is the sum of aquaculture and capture fish production. Data are expressed in live weight equivalent.

Arable land does not include land that is potentially cultivable but is not normally cultivated. Source: FAO, Statistics Division Owner: FAOAREA HARVESTED Area harvested refers to the area from which a crop is gathered. It excludes, therefore, the area from which, although sown or planted, there was no harvest due to damage, failure, etc. It is usually net of temporary crops and sometimes gross of permanent crops. The net area differs from the gross area insofar as the latter includes uncultivated patches, footpaths, ditches, headlands, shoulders, shelterbelts, etc. If the crop under consideration is harvested more than once during the year as a consequence of successive cropping (i.e. the same crop is sown or planted more than once in the same field during the year), the area is counted as many times as harvested. Source: FAO, Statistics Division Owner: FAO CAPTURE FISH PRODUCTION Hunting, collecting and gathering activities directed at removing or collecting live wild aquatic organisms are capture fish production. The capture production statistics here indicates the nominal catches of aquatic organisms, killed, caught, trapped or collected for all commercial, industrial, recreational and subsistence purposes or other utilizations in live weight equivalent. Data included here cover capture production of fish, molluscs, crustaceans and miscellaneous aquatic animals but exclude production of marine mammals, crocodiles, corals, pearls, sponges and aquatic plants. Fish production 46 WORLD FOOD AND AGRICULTURE STATISTICAL YEARBOOK 2021is the sum of aquaculture and capture fish production. Source: Fisheries and Aquaculture Division Owner: FAO CEREAL IMPORT DEPENDENCY RATIO The cereal import dependency ratio provides a measure of the dependence of a country or region from cereal imports. The higher the value of the indicator, the higher the dependence. Specifically, the cereal imports dependency ratio tells how much of the available domestic food supply of cereals has been imported and how much comes from the countrys own production. It is computed as (cereal imports - cereal exports) (cereal production  cereal imports - cereal exports)  100. Given this formula the indicator assumes only values less than or equal to 100. Negative values indicate that the country is a net exporter of cereals. The indicator is calculated in three- year averages, to reduce the impact of possible errors in estimated production and trade, due to the difficulties in properly accounting for stock variations in major foods.

Source: FAO, Statistics Division Owner: FAO LAND UNDER PERMANENT MEADOWS AND PASTURES Land used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops through cultivation or naturally (wild prairie or grazing land) is considered land under permanent meadows and pastures. Permanent meadows and pastures on which trees and shrubs are grown should be recorded under this heading only if the growing of forage crops is the most important use of the area. Measures may be taken to keep or increase productivity of the land (i.e. use of fertilizers, mowing or 51 ANNEXES systematic grazing by domestic animals.) This class includes:  grazing in wooded areas (agroforestry areas, for example)  grazing in shrubby zones (heath, maquis, garigue)  grassland in the plain or low mountain areas used for grazing: land crossed during transhumance where the animals spend a part of the year (approximately 100 days) without returning to the holding in the evening: mountain and subalpine meadows and similar; and steppes and dry meadows used for pasture.

FOLU emissions consist of CO2 (carbon dioxide), CH4 (methane) and N2O (nitrous oxide) associated with land management activities. CO2 emissionsremovals are derived from estimated net carbon stock changes in above- and below-ground biomass pools of forest land, including forest land converted to other land uses. CH4 and N2O, and additional CO2 emissions are estimated for fires and drainage of organic soils. The FAOSTAT emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories.

However, due to some country reporting practices, the data may be reported by: use in formulated product; sales; distribution or imports for use in the agricultural sector. Source: FAO, Statistics Division Owner: FAO PREVALENCE OF MODERATE OR SEVERE FOOD INSECURITY The prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity is an estimate of the percentage of people in the population who live in households classified as moderately or severely food insecure. The assessment is conducted using data collected with the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) or a compatible experience-based food security measurement questionnaire (such as the Household Food Security Survey Module  HFSSM). The probability to be food insecure is estimated using the one-parameter logistic Item Response Theory model (the Rasch model) and thresholds for classification are made cross-country comparable by calibrating the metrics obtained in each country against the FIES global reference scale, maintained by FAO. The threshold to classify moderate or severe food insecurity corresponds to the severity associated with the item having to eat less on the global FIES scale. In simpler terms, a household is classified as moderately or severely food insecure when at least one adult in the household was reported to have been exposed, at times during the year, to low-quality 53 ANNEXES diets and might have been forced to also reduce the quantity of food they would normally eat because of a lack of money or other resources. It is an indicator of a lack of food access.

Source: FAO, Statistics Division Owner: FAO PRODUCTION Figures relate to the total domestic production whether inside or outside the agricultural sector, i.e. it includes non-commercial production and production from kitchen gardens. Unless otherwise indicated, production is reported at the farm level for crop and livestock products (i.e. in the case of crops, excluding harvesting losses) and in terms of live weight for fish items (i.e. the actual ex-water weight at time of catch). All data shown relate to total meat production from both commercial and farm slaughter. Data are expressed in terms of dressed carcass weight, excluding offal and slaughter fats. Production of beef and buffalo meat includes veal; mutton and goat meat includes meat from lambs and kids; pig meat includes bacon and ham in fresh equivalent. Poultry meat includes meat from all domestic birds and refers, wherever possible, to ready-to-cook weight. Source: FAO, Statistics Division Owner: FAO PRODUCTION, CROPS Production and crops refer to the actual harvested production from the field or orchard and gardens, excluding harvesting and threshing losses and that part of a crop not harvested for any reason.
